> Speaking of bullets, the man who eventually assassinated American President James Garfield, Charles Guiteau, was certain they had a close personal connection (which, of course, Garfield never knew about.) The Internet has [driven a surge](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/modern-mentality/201810/is-social-media-making-you-lonely) in these one-sided “parasocial” relationships. Algorithms on these platforms are designed to boost engagement and view time, even if the content is [harmful or raises false hopes](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/psychiatrists-perspective-social-media-algorithms-and-mental-health). Explore how social media also affects the health of [adults and seniors](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2022/02/right-now-social-media-adult-depression), then discuss with your team: who should be held responsible when an algorithm [promotes harmful content](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24121461/myanmar-genocide-section-230-facebook-internet-social-media-moderation)? Could you design an algorithm to craft a healthier, happier society—and would it be successful?

## Who Should Be Responsible When An Algorithm Promotes Harmful Content?

In my opinion, morally, it’s the users of the platform that kept watching harmful content, teaching it to recommend more of it.

Legally, I think it should be partly the creator of the content and partly the team at the company which trained the training algorithm for the algorithm.

Look at what happened to Twitter (Elon Musk: *clears throat*)...

Sorry, X — it’s filled with **racial slurs by politicians, rage bait from startup CEOs, and parasocial delusions from Elon himself,** all disguised as *”just jokes, bro”*.

## Could You Design A Better Algorithm?

**Yes.**

## **Definitely, Yes.**

Look at [[02 - The Best is Yet to Be, or Not To Be/07 - Social media, algorithms, and accidental harm/bluesky]], it’s already halfway there.

What we need is **algorithms created by users intentionally, not unintentionally**. If they want to view harmful content, they should explicitly say that.

And if we leave our social media up to these Big Tech Companies, this’ll never happen — all they care about is ad revenue and data. That barely lines up with “Let users choose what they want to see”.
