> In 2021, the UN Development Program found that living conditions in [90% of the world's countries](https://www.dw.com/en/un-index-shows-living-standards-declining-in-90-of-countries/a-63052023) had declined for the second year in a row—possibly contributing to [declining birth rates](https://www.insights.uca.org.au/is-the-cost-of-living-crisis-just-the-new-normal/). Discuss with your team: is [this decline irreversible](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/dependency-and-depopulation-confronting-the-consequences-of-a-new-demographic-reality) or will the world’s population begin to boom again? Should we want it to?

This is genuinely the first time that we have had our population drop because of a reason that seems natural, or… not weird. Every other time, it was because of war (Post WW2) or a disease (Influenza) or something that could occur suddenly and go away just as quick.

Poverty is not one of those.

## Is This Decline Irreversible?

Probably not, we’ve had huge population drops before and still recovered. But I feel like it’s different right now since fertility rates are also down, but they’re still above 2.1. 

## Should We Want It To?

I think we shouldn’t. Killing already existing people on purpose is “immoral”, so preventing new ones from being born is the sole thing that will solve this supply and demand crisis that we have in this world right now.

We have already overpopulated this world, unless someone has a plan to give everyone money (step 1) and send half the world to another planet or find a way to get more land on earth (step 2), the only way to have a stable economy is to reduce the population. ^a6a4ad

I feel like we’ve crossed a line on a graph — the larger the population, the less money we have to support each person separately. If the population goes too high, we’ll have less money — making people die to balance the population again.

This is nature’s way of making sure we don’t mess up and have a tiny economy with a large population. Also, the economy isn’t just money — it’s land. And we don’t have much easy to obtain land left.
