> A butterfly flaps its wings and a hurricane (eventually) pops to life on the other side of the world. Small changes can have large impacts that may not be as random (or unpredictable) as they seem. Explore the field of chaos theory, which attempts to understand how complex systems are built up from simple parts, then discuss with your team: are there examples of such systems in society, and can they help us tell the future?
