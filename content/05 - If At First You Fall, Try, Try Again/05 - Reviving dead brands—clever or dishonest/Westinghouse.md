Huge in electrical equipment, radio, and later TV—founded in 1886 by George Westinghouse. They basically invented a lot of power grid tech and broadcasting stuff.

By the late 1990s, the original Westinghouse Corporation had mostly pivoted to media (they owned CBS for a bit) and sold off its industrial divisions. The company name eventually disappeared as a corporate entity.

Westinghouse now mostly exists as a licensed brand slapped on TVs, appliances, and nuclear energy products. CBS and Westinghouse electric (now a shell owned by Japanese/other industrial companies) control most of the game. It’s just nostalgia marketing.
