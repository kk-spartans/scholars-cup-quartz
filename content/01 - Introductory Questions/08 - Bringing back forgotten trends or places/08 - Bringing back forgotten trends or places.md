> Take a step back from the broader future to zoom in on small things that can also be recalled to life with new vitality: musical bands, TV shows, even products once abandoned to museums and overstock warehouses. (For instance, walk around your school and may spot someone buzzing about with a film camera.) We’ll investigate them more later in this outline, but, for now, what other dead or derelict institutions, products, or trends do you think will become popular again in our lifetimes? Is there a restaurant that you and your family miss that you wish would be revived—and how much effort would you be willing to put into that revival?

I feel like, right now (even though I don’t see it much in my community), these things will mostly take over the the world (or are taking over the world) by storm:

 - Flip Phones / Dumb Phones — Most people think they get distracted by the social media on actual phones so they use these (even though most just hate it and switch back)
 
 - Vinyl Records — Audiophile boomers think this is the only way to get “true” lossless audio even thought CDs exist — or even better, FLAC.

 - Y2K Fashion: — I don’t know how to explain this.
 
 - Tarot, Astrology, and Other Ancient Vibes: We’ll cover this later (I hoped because I didn’t want to do it then)
 - Film / Analogue Cameras — Because it’s higher quality and captures feelings instead of pixels
 
 - **Mechanical Keyboards:** I can’t express in words the amount of people building custom mechanical keyboards right now. While we have better switches and keycaps, the tech is still the same as the 80s (Although it looks and feels *SO* much better).

That’s basically it.
