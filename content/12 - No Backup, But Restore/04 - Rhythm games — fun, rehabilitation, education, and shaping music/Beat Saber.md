You hold your controllers in your hand. In the game — they’re long sticks that vibrate when they overlap. You have to hit boxes coming at you in a specific direction (shown with the arrows on them), and dodge containers.

If you don’t dodge the containers or miss a box, you lose your multiplier. The more boxes you hit, the more points you get. With songs like Rush E over here, it’s an actual vigorous exercise.

Really fun game, very moddable.
