> Listen to the song “[Section 52 (Morning Sun, I Built the Stairs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBwS2WoTe-Q)” by the Polyphonic Spree, and then consider whether it feels more like a song about beginnings, endings, or starting over again. Is it optimistic about what comes next? Are you?

It’s more about starting over — especially with lines like “In the morning sun I am awakened” or “From all of the fire that's born in the sky”.

And it’s very optimistic about the future, feels like it’s trying to say something like: “Look, I made the climb. I survived. Now watch me soar.”

I don’t really think I’m an optimistic person. I just feel like everyone should just try to know what’s coming, and not rate it — and if I had to, it’s probably going to be pessimistic.
