> If you’ve ever gone camping on a cold night, you might have gathered around a fire with your friends to toast tasty s’mores and tell tasty stories.

Explore the [mythologies that emerged in early civilizations](https://library.acropolis.org/keeping-the-flame-alive/) around the idea of keeping a fire alive and well, then discuss with your team: is there anything else similar to fire that is easier to keep alive than to restart once it is gone—and, if so, who tends to it?

Just read the article to know the myths.
