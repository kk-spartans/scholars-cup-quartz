This is what gpt4o #ai would tell me how a person in the 1920s would live:

- I wake up to the clanging of an alarm clock. The kind you wind up by hand and it sounds like a miniature train wreck. My bed’s a bit lumpy-stuffed with cotton or maybe horsehair if I'm lucky-and it squeaks if I so much as breathe too hard.

- I leave the bedroom and walk into the parlor. There’s a radio in the corner, big as a nightstand, humming some jazz if I fiddle with the dial just right. The house is decent-coal stove downstairs, drafty windows, but it keeps the rain out.

- I brush my teeth with a hard-bristled brush and baking soda paste that tastes like regret. Then it’s off to the washroom, where I fill the tub myself. Hot water if the heater’s working, cold water if it's not. Either way, it's a workout.

- Breakfast’s simple-maybe eggs and toast if there’s time, or a bowl of porridge. Sometimes cornflakes, which are still kind of new and suspiciously bland.

- Stepping outside, I see brick buildings, all modest in height unless I’m downtown. Streetlamps line the roads, and they’re electric, though half of them flicker like they owe someone money. It’s loud, smoky, and full of Model Ts and streetcars rattling past.

- I catch a streetcar to school-clunky, crowded, smells like oil and old newspapers. But it gets the job done.

- At school, we cover reading, arithmetic, some geography, a little history. Nothing fancy-definitely nothing involving machines that do math for you. Most of the day is reciting and writing on a slate.

- I take the same streetcar home. Maybe it’s raining. Maybe someone’s yelling. Classic commute.

- Back home, I do chores or maybe read a bit. If I’ve got any free time, I listen to the radio-comedy shows, music, maybe a news report if I want to feel like I understand the world. No screens, just voices in a box.

- I go to bed while the radio plays soft swing music. If I’m lucky, the neighbors aren’t fighting and the rats stay in the walls.
