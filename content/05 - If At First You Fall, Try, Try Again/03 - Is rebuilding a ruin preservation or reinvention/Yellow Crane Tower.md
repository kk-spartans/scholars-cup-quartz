The tower’s mythic origins reach back to the Three Kingdoms era (3rd century CE) and it became a recurring literary and cultural motif; the structure has been destroyed and rebuilt many times across dynasties.

The current building (completed 1985) is a modern concrete-and-wood recreation on the historical site that intentionally references classical architectural language and the tower’s poetic associations.
