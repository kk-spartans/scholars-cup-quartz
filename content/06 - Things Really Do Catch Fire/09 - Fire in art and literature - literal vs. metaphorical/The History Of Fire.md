Metaphorical.

 - Mother — potential energy
 - Father — Molten, unstoppable
 - Grandmother — the spark, small, but could start everything...?
 - Sister — easily ignited, impulsive, and emotionally vulnerable
 - Grandfather — trees usually mean abundant fuel, so the grandfather is that
 - Brothers — unpredictable, explosive, volatile
 - The poet — the aftermath of all this :(
