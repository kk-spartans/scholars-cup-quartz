> Don’t worry, Australia—you’re not alone. (More on loneliness later.) In Canada, a proposed high-speed rail network had its target speed slashed before being rebranded as a [high *frequency*](https://thewalrus.ca/high-speed-rail/) network. In many developed countries, ambitious projects have [gone out of fashion](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bertha-seattle-infrastructure-trouble-megaprojects) in favor of slow, incremental ones. Check out the mega projects below, as well as those from your own country, then discuss with your team: is this shift in approach justified? How might megaprojects (or their failure) affect the way people [perceive progress?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02513625.2019.1630189#d1e235) And are some countries more consistently successful at these projects?

## Is This Shift In Approach justified?

Sometimes, yeah. Politicians love cutting ribbons but don't wanna pay the bills. Switching to small incremental projects can make them (and people) feel like there is progress happening (and to an extent, there is). These projects are easier to manage, budget, and most importantly - finish. But it also reeks of a system that's afraid to dream big because it keeps tripping over its own shoelaces.

## How Might Megaprojects (or Their failure) Affect The Way People Perceive progress?

They mess with people’s heads. A flashy megaproject = “the future is now.” A stalled one = “we’re going nowhere.” So when they fail, it’s not just money lost—it’s public trust and optimism

## Are Some Countries More Consistently Successful At These projects?

Yes, some countries like China, the UAE, and (maybe) South Korea have a greater success rate on megaprojects because of their more *relaxed* approach to red tape. Countries with a quadrillion approval stages (USA) tend to struggle more. Unless they get really motivated (Post WW2).
