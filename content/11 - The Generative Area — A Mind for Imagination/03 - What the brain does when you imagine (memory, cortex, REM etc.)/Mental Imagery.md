The ability to see or sense things in the mind itself without anything external. Can be all 5 senses, although anything other than sight and hearing is hard to recreate (in my experience). This is the only way abstract thought is possible.

Without mental imagery, everything feels flat, less engaging, and harder to change mentally. Dreaming, visualization, etc. all need this to exist.
