(claude sonnet 4 #ai generated)

Look at the differences here:

- Rn, we wake up with phones that control our entire house and track our sleep. In 2005 we had chunky red LED alarm clocks that did exactly one thing.

- Our entertainment now has actual AI that can write and create art. Back then we were hyped about YouTube existing and thought buffering 240p videos was peak tech.
   
- The internet went from dial-up torture to faster speeds in our pockets than entire universities had back then.
   
- Social media barely existed - MySpace was peak networking with glittery GIFs. Now we have apps that make people famous for 15-second dances.
   
- Music went from burning CDs and chunky iPods to having every song ever made available instantly. Spotify would've sounded like magic.
   
- Shopping meant actually going to stores. Amazon existed but was sus. Now we get anything delivered in 2 hours.
   
- Phones went from flip phones that played Snake to pocket computers more powerful than our "advanced" computer science desktops.
   
- GPS meant buying a $300 TomTom that would direct you into lakes. Now Google Maps knows where you are before you do.
   
- We rented DVDs from Blockbuster like it was convenient. Netflix mailed DVDs and instant streaming was science fiction.
   
- Social plans required advance notice because texting cost money per message and we wrote "r u going 2 the party 2nite?" to save characters.
