> “The best is yet to be,” wrote the English poet [[01 - Introductory Questions/07 - Convincing a pessimist the future matters/Robert Browning]], a phrase often quoted (out of context) to evoke a sense of possibility and hope. But we now live, [many people are saying](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-speech-cognitive-state-ezra-klein-podcast-1972996), in a [pessimistic age](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23632673/against-doomerism)–in which some people even avoid having children to [protect them](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2024/05/climate-scientists-crisis-decision-have-children-kids-childbearing/) from the grim days ahead. If you met someone who was sure the future would be full of suffering, would you try to give them hope again? If so, what would you tell them?

I would try to give them hope with these reasons

 - Mostly (other than the eras of kingdoms, etc.), the future became better — not worse. What makes you think it’ll be worse now? Pollution?
 
 - If it **is** pollution/global warming/climate change, we’ve had that since the 1900s and it’s increasing now, so is the population.

 - And also, we’re making ***insane*** progress on slowing down the effects of pollution rn — just look at australia with the bans on all gas stoves, ramping production of EV batteries, and Tesla Solar rolling out.

If they still don’t agree, I don’t know what do say.
