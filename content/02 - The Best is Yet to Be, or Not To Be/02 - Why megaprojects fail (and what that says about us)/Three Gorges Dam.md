## What Happened Before

The Yangtze River floods were frequent, and China’s electricity demand was skyrocketing. So in the 1990s, the government pushed forward with plans to build the world’s largest hydroelectric dam.

## What Happened During

Started in 1994, completed in 2012. Over 1.3 million people were forced to move, ancient towns were submerged or destroyed, and ecosystems were annihilated. It cost $30B+, but the dam became a symbol of China’s rise and might. Also, some say it slightly slowed the Earth’s rotation (NASA measured it to be around 60 ns because of the weight displacement).

## What Happened After

It now powers millions of homes and is considered an essential part of China’s energy mix. But it’s also blamed for landslides, habitat loss, and triggering minor earthquakes. It works, but came at an enormous human and environmental cost.
