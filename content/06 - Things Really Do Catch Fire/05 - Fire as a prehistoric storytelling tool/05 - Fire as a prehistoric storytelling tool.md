> For early humans, fire was surely useful for cooking raw Macrauchenia and for fending off saber-toothed tigers—but could it also have been used to create the ancient equivalent of cartoons? Consider this research into the prehistoric use of fire as [a tool for animation](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ice-age-artists-may-have-used-firelight-to-animate-carvings-180979943/), then discuss with your team: is this a form of art (or entertainment) that we should be reviving today? Can you imagine other forms of storytelling that utilize natural phenomena—for instance, strong winds—in a similar way?

## Should We Revive This?

**Yes.** It’s exhilarating, dangerous, and a hazard to the environment. Maybe we should even burn different materials to get different colors of fires.

## Natural Forms Of Storytelling

 - [Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvHJ6KQJwyw) — it looks even better in person, especially when the water soaks you (sarcasm), trust me.
 - Ice Sculptures
 - Sand Sculptures
 - Controlled plant growth?
 - Winds - make it blow into things that create noises at frequencies specific enough to sound like human voices.
