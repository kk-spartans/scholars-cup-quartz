Made by claude sonnet 4 #ai because I was lazy:

- In 1820, you woke up when the rooster felt like screaming at you. By 1920, you had an actual alarm clock that sounded like a train wreck but at least showed up on time.

- Entertainment went from "stare at the fire and hope someone tells a good story" to having a magical box that played jazz music from thin air. The radio was basically the internet of 1920, except it only had one channel and you couldn't skip ads.

- Living standards jumped from "please let the roof hold" to "we have indoor plumbing and it usually works." Going from a straw mattress that sounded like a snack bag to an actual bed with springs was probably life-changing.

- Transportation evolved from walking miles through cow pies and mud to hopping on a streetcar that smelled like oil but got you there without stepping in anything questionable.

- Education expanded beyond the three R's and a teacher with a terrifyingly large switch. By 1920, you might actually learn geography from a real map instead of one drawn from someone's questionable memory.

- The economy shifted from bartering and hoping your pig cooperated to actual wages and public transport that cost pennies. Though to be fair, pennies probably bought way more back then than they do now.

- Hygiene went from "cloth and maybe some salt if we're fancy" to actual toothbrushes and baking soda paste that tasted like regret. Still an upgrade though.

- Social life changed from neighbors being a mile away to living close enough to hear them fighting through the walls. Progress, I guess?
