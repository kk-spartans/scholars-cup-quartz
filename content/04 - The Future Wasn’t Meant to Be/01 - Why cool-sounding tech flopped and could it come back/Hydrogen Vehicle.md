Vehicles powered hydrogen, people imagined they would work in one of two of ways:

 - Burning it just like you burn fuel (inefficient and hard, but still no pollution).
 - Using hydrogen fuel cells (I barely understand how this works)

## Hydrogen Fuel Cells

(gpt5 #ai generated)

In a hydrogen fuel cell:

1. **Hydrogen enters the anode side**  
    The anode has a catalyst (often platinum) that rips each hydrogen molecule (H₂) apart into two protons (H⁺) and two electrons (e⁻).
    
2. **Protons go through, electrons go around**  
    The protons pass through a special membrane (polymer electrolyte membrane, PEM) to the cathode side.  
    The electrons can’t get through the membrane, so they’re forced to travel through a wire—this is your electric current.
    
3. **Oxygen joins the party**  
    On the cathode side, oxygen from the air (O₂) meets the protons and electrons coming from opposite directions. The catalyst there helps them combine into H₂O—plain water.

So the full reaction is:  
**2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O + electricity + heat**

The electricity runs your motors, the heat is mostly waste, and the water gets dumped out the tailpipe like the car is sweating.

But creating these cells is **insanely** expensive, especially the Platinum and Proton Exchange Membrane. So people mostly just used EVs.
