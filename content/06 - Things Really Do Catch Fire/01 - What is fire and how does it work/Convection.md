When heat gets moved around by the objects holding heat moving, instead of creeping through a solid (conduction) or shooting it out like light (radiation).

A good example is rain,

 - Sun heats ground, ground heats the air
 - That air’s pressure lowers, it get’s lighter, and floats up because of buoyancy
 - When it rises, it cools because higher altitudes = lower pressure
 - Cool air can’t be as humid, so the water is let down as rain

*completely unrelated*

You might be wondering, why is the air at higher altitudes lower pressure anyway?

It’s because of gravity, more air is bunched towards the bottom because of it’s mass and when it can’t anymore, it slowly moves up — with lower pressure there.
