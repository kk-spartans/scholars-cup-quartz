Made of 2 things — gasoline (or a different hydrocarbon), and a thickening agent (aluminum naphthenate, or polystyrene).

Sticks to skin and surfaces, burns extremely hot, causes extreme respiratory damage, sets structures on fire, and is hard to extinguish with water.

Made of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, hexane, heptane, octane — anything that will dissolve in the thickener and burn.

And a thickening agent, like aluminum naphthenate, palmitate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, styrene butadiene — anything that’ll dissolve fuels and forms a gel.
