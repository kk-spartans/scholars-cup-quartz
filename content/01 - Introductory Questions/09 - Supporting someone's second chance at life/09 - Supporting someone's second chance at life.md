> While actual resurrection is *probably* still impossible, individuals can still be recalled to life in different ways, as in this [first book](https://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/22/a-tale-of-two-cities/108/book-the-first-recalled-to-lifechapter-1-the-period/) of [[01 - Introductory Questions/09 - Supporting someone's second chance at life/A Tale of Two Cities]]–whether it is after incarceration, illness, or a different kind of darkness. Do you know anyone who has found a new lease on life in this way? How can we best support someone who is starting over again?

I don't feel like I personally know someone like this, but there are some celebs who are like this.

## Examples Of People Who Found New Leases On Life

(Summaries generated by gpt4o #ai)

 - **Robert Downey Jr.:** Literal poster child for self-destruction -> redemption. He went from being blacklisted due to drug abuse and arrests to becoming Iron Man and one of the highest-paid actors in the world. Studios wouldn’t insure him at one point. Now he is the insurance.

 - **Drew Barrymore:** Was in rehab at 13. Grew up in the Hollywood chaos machine (flashback E.T), flamed out young, and then quietly rebuilt. Now she’s a producer, talk show host, and literal ray of sunshine with emotional range and business chops.

 - **Brendan Fraser:** Physically wrecked, emotionally devastated, blacklisted after speaking out about abuse. For years he was gone from the spotlight—and then came The Whale, and the world remembered why we loved him. The guy cried during his standing ovation, and so did everyone else.


## How We Can Help Them

In my experience, this works:

 - Believe them before they do anything trustworthy, this encourages them to gain your (and other people's) trust.
 
 - Shut up and listen, or just pretend to listen - they probably won't even care. Some people just need a human echo chamber.
 
 - Stop reminding them of their past, especially accidentally.
 
 - Don't smother them in support that they don't want. Respect their boundaries.
