Part of the Xiuhpōhualli (ʃiːw.poː.ˈwal.li). Had 365 days in a year. With 18 months each with 20 days and 5 “empty” (bad luck) days.

Each month was for specific agricultural activities; festivals, deities, planting, harvesting, rain ceremonies, etc.

And the empty days were basically their way of saying “nothing good will happen this week”
