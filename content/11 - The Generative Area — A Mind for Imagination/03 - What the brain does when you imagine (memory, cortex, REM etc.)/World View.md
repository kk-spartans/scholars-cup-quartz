World view is the mental framework shaping how individuals interpret events, ideas, and social norms. It is informed by culture, experience, and belief systems. This lens colors imagination, defining what seems plausible or fantastical.

Altering a person’s world view—through exposure to radically different ideas or trauma—reshapes imagination. Scenarios once deemed impossible may seem normal, while familiar constructs can feel alien, expanding or restricting creative possibilities.
