- Breaking News (“This just in!”)
- Every outlet and their cousin is talking about it.
- Experts; x, reddit, threads, and bsky threads; and hot takes all overanalyze it.
- Public burnout – People stop caring.
- Replacement – New story kicks it off again.

Example: OpenAI’s gpt5 drop (although the some people, including me, used it on openrouter as anonymous models). I can predict this’ll happen before reddit even finished talking about it.
