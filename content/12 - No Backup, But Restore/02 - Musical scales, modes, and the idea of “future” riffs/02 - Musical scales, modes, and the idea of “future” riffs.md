> “Liberally mix major and minor scales and lydian mode,” [one blogger advises](https://www.heather-fenoughty.com/composing-music/how-to-compose-science-fiction-music-my-personal-recipe/) anyone on a (five-or-more-minute) mission to write music with a science fiction flavor. What do these terms mean, and Is there such a thing as a “future” riff—a musical shortcut that helps to set a time and place, but in this case for a time and place that haven’t happened yet? Be sure to consider the song “[A TV Show Called Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UKuQkhdpvs)” and to discuss with your team: does the songwriter choose to make it sound alien or futuristic—and, if so, how?

 - Major and minor scales — The bread and butter of Western music.
	- Major = happy, bright.
	- Minor = sad, dark.

	A mix of both creates tonal whiplash, sci-fi loves tonal whiplash.

 - Lydian mode — This is like a major scale but with a raised fourth note. That single tweak makes music sound floaty, dreamy, or alien because it messes with your sense of “home base” harmony. John Williams uses it in the E.T. theme, and it screams “wonder of the unknown.”

## Future Riff Shortcut

(gpt5 #ai generated)

 There isn’t one universal “future sound,” but sci-fi composers cheat by:

- Using weird intervals (tritones, whole tones) to sound off-kilter.
- Throwing in synth textures and reverb for “space vibes.”
- Mixing modes and tonalities to avoid sounding “earthly” or predictable.

## A TV Show Called Earth

This is a good song imo, but it tries to distance itself from every single genre that we know — it’s not sad, hip hop, pop, happy, etc. It’s just... a song.

It doesn’t really sound alien or futuristic to me (other than the line “And they’ve watched every single one of since birth”) — especially with the “and the writing’s done downhill in the past year”.

“And to us it may seem cruel, how they keep a betting pool on the way the human storyline will end” — that’s just trying to make people feel bad, not futuristic, or fond of aliens.
