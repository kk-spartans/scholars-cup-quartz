Osamu Tezuka’s mid-20th century manga/anime about a lion cub who grows up to try to build a peaceful jungle society, mixing family drama with ecological and ethical themes. It was one of Japan’s first color TV anime and became a major cultural touchstone; later, people pointed out similarities between *Kimba* and Disney’s *The Lion King*. The series is earnest, sometimes preachy, and surprisingly deep for its era.
