- **Trying to be:** The Roman Empire, but Greek-speaking and Christian.
- **How close?** In administration and law, very much Roman; militarily and territorially, they never matched Rome’s peak. But they outlasted Rome in the West by *1,000 years*.
- **Longevity:** Western Roman Empire lasted ~500 years; Byzantines lasted over 1,100. That’s a massive sequel win.
