> Later artists and writers adapted futurism’s interest in technology to imagine liberation and empowerment for different communities. Research the [history of Afrofuturism](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/afrofuturism), from its origins in the Space Age to Marvel’s Wakanda Forever, then discuss with your team: [what makes something 'Afrofuturist'](https://artreview.com/the-past-and-future-of-afrofuturism/)? Could an artist be ['Asiafuturist'](https://www.tribephotomagazine.com/issue-09/larissa-sansour-heirloom) or 'Amerifuturist' instead?

Afrofuturism has historical anchoring (links diasporic memory), tech and myths, and imagines repair and autonomy (not just aesthetic futurism).

And there can definitely be asiafuturist / amerifuturist. They already exist in multiple forms, and each time it just moves the focus to a a different place’s community. The only rule here is that a valid -futurism must grow from its community’s conditions, not just borrow aesthetic.
