The painting looks really moody; head bowed, eyes shut.

I think the artist is trying to tell us to embrace the peace and serenity that’s there right now — instead of trying to predict the future (like every other painting).

This could also just be a fortune teller which is trying to predict the future and is also calm, which makes this painting the odd one out.
