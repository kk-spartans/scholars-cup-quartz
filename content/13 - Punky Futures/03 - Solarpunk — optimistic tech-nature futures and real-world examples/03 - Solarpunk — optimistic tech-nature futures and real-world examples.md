> [Solarpunk](https://solarpunks.net/) offers a more optimistic vision of the future, one in which technology and nature exist in harmony rather than conflict. Consider *Sim City 2000*’s [arcologies](https://simcity.fandom.com/wiki/Arcology), futuristic mega-structures designed to support entire communities. In the real world, solarpunk can inform anything from [architecture](https://architizer.com/blog/inspiration/stories/solarpunk-architecture-and-the-built-future/) to [game design](https://www.greengamedesign.com/solarpunk-games/). Consider the following works. How do they convey a feeling of optimism about technology and the future, and have any solarpunk dreams been realized? Discuss with your team: would you like to live in a solarpunk future?

Some of these “dreams” are happening — renewable energy, green architecture, vertical gardens — but we’re still far from fully self sustaining or carbon negative cities. This is more of a game design philosophy than a mainstream lifestyle.

I would definitely live in it — as long as it doesn’t come with endless VR mindfulness lectures
