Though dangerous, fireworks remain popular around the world. Research their history with your team. What were the earliest fireworks—widely believed to have been invented in China—made of, and what was their purpose? When and how did they become the bright and colorful displays they are today? Discuss with your team: should they be outlawed, and, if so, is there something that could replace them in the popular imagination?

## History

Originated in China at around the 7th century. Started as bamboo tubes filled with gunpowder that would explode when thrown into a fire (mostly noise, no light).

The early ones were for scaring off evil spirits and celebrating festivals (like Chinese New Year). The noise was protective.

By the 10-12th century, fireworks became more sophisticated in China with colored sparks made by adding [[06 - Things Really Do Catch Fire/06 - History and safety of fireworks/List of colors made by substances in fireworks\|metals]].

Europeans got them around the 13-14th centuries by trading with the Mongol conquests. Initially used in royal ceremonies and military displays.

The colorful, choreographed shows we see today took off in 17-18th century Europe, mostly in Italy. It spread to the world in about the 19th century.

## Made Of

Usually have an oxidizer (potassium nitrate), fuel (sulfur / charcoal), starches / dextrin, and a coloring agent.

## Should They Be Banned?

Yes — [ABSOLUTELY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fireworks_accidents_and_incidents_in_Sivakasi). You can just have insanely large displays like [The Las Vegas Sphere](https://maps.app.goo.gl/o4xzVa5fmC8rs48w6). You just need 150 [A6000s](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/products/workstations/rtx-a6000/), running 16,000 x 16,000 pixel displays. With 108 petabytes of flash storage that delivers at 81TB/S, just for the interior.

Or you could just throw [drone shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G1KBu6H6BM) like Japan and China (the logistics for that must’ve been insanity).
