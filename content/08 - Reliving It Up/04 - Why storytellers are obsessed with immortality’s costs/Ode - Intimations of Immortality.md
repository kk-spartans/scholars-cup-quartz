As kids, we see the world glowing with wonder because we’re still close to the divine mystery we came from (“trailing clouds of glory”). But as we grow up, that vision fades—routine, custom, and the grind of adulthood dull it. Nature is still beautiful, but it no longer has the same magical shine.

Yet, all isn’t lost. The memory of that childhood vision—“the glory and the dream”—lingers inside us. Even in grief, it gives strength, consolation, and meaning. Basically: **childhood = divine vision, adulthood = disillusionment, memory of childhood = hope + wisdom.**
