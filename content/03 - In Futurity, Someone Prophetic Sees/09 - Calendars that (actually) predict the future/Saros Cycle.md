The Saros cycle is a ~18 year, ~11.33 day period after which nearly identical eclipses repeat — solar or lunar. This works because the Moon’s orbit and Earth’s rotation sync up roughly after this time. It’s not perfect (eclipses shift slightly each cycle), but close enough that ancient astronomers could use it to predict future eclipses with shocking accuracy.

- **1 Saros = 6585.32 days ≈ 18 years, 11⅓ days**
- **1 synodic month = 29.53059 days**
- **1 draconic month = 27.21222 days**
- **1 anomalistic month = 27.55455 days**
