Sold $400 machines (The Juicero Press) that squeezed juice out of proprietary packets (you could squeeze it just as easily with your hand). They raised $120 Million in VC funds.

After the media discovered this information from [Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-04-19/silicon-valley-s-400-juicer-may-be-feeling-the-squeeze), Juicero doubled down and was looking for buyers of the company. Sometime later, the founder (Doug Evans) decided to move into making:

 - Smoothies and baby food
 - A subscription for delivering healthy food to your house
 - Selling the press's (overly overcomplicated) tech to other food companies: **There were no takers.**

None of these ideas succeeded, the founder is now the CEO of The sprouting company, which helps you grow plants at home easier. He also published the most popular book under amazon's "plants" category: The Sprout Book.
