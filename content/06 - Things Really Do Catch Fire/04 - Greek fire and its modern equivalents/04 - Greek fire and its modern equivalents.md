> A fire that no one can extinguish: not Los Angeles in 2025 but a deadly weapon in Byzantine Greece. Learn the science and history of [Greek fire](https://history.howstuffworks.com/world-history/greek-fire.htm). Would it still be a useful weapon today, and what are its closest modern-day equivalents? Be sure to study the examples of napalm, thermite, and white phosphorus.

*tl;dr on the article:*

Greek fire is speculated to be made of:

- pine resin
- naphtha
- quicklime
- calcium phosphide
- sulfur
- niter

Super nasty incendiary that could burn on water, shot from siphons on ships.

Napalm is the closest modern day equivalent to Greek Fire, maybe even worse. And thermite is [insanity](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EMcIpHH8j7M).

Would it still be a useful weapon today? Probably not â€” we use nuclear missiles, not fires, in wars nowadays.
