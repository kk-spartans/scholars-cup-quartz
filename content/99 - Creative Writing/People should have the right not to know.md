According to France, **’Moral Rights’ doesn’t even let you waiver copyright.**

On the internet, you can’t just waiver the right to know once you’re plugged in — how would big tech steal your data for ads?

The “right not to know” isn’t a law, it’s a mindset — and more importantly, a survival skill in the age of infinite information.

Right now, I can almost guarantee that you have some form of social media installed on at least one of your devices. Is that your fault? Mostly — other than when OEMs preinstall them (you could also just uninstall or disable them).

Why did you install / not uninstall these apps? Because we **need** to know information, the human brain has a large encephalization quotient for a reason.

The problem arrives when we use those brain cells too much for things that don’t matter. To understand this, we need to understand the algorithms behind these things.

These models are **smart**, they don’t just look at the hashtags and like counts - they analyze every single part of your content:

 - The text on the screen
 - The objects in the background
 - Your looks (look bad = less views, sad but true)
 - Objects on the screen
 - Your mood(s)
 - Background music, and it’s pacing and tone — maybe even shazam it and find people who like that music.
 - The semantically embedded transcription
 - Any text overlays

And a bunch of more things that you didn’t know a computer could even do. If you post a linguistics video and say “encephalization quotient” 30 times, it still classifies it as linguistics. No wonder it takes ages to upload a video to youtube.

It takes all of that and tokenizes it (same thing that AI models use), and sees if that matches a viewer’s tokenized profile, which is created by analyzing every single thing you do that they can legally get their hands on — even the angle at which your finger scrolls the content.

For example, if you comment “this is so me” on a video, it knows that you like it — even though you didn’t press like (which people only do when they think a video is extraordinary, you scroll on a good one) it says “ah, this is nerd bait” and serve it to people like you.

Even this very text uses one of these techniques, repetitivity — you’ve heard the things in this essay dozens of times before, and you’re still reading through it — if there’s a lot of something or people seem to like it, it’s true.

You already have the right to not know, you’re just not using it. You don’t know how to and don’t want to.
