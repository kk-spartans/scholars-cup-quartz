Erected in phases between ~3000 and 1500 BCE, Stonehenge is an archaeological palimpsest of Neolithic and Bronze Age ritual landscapes.

Over the 20th century conservators reset some fallen stones and re-erected a few that had toppled — interventions done to stabilize and conserve rather than to “rebuild” into a new monument — while ongoing research keeps revising the site’s story.
