Let's tell the future

Let's see how it's been done

By numbers, by mirrors, by water

By dots made at random on paper

By salt, by dice

By meal, by mice

By dough of cakes

By sacrificial fire

By fountains, by fishes

Writings in ashes

Birds, herbs

Smoke from the altar

A suspended ring or the mode of laughing

Pebbles drawn from a heap

One of these things

Will tell you something

Let's tell the future

Let's see how it's been done

By dreams, by the features, by letters

By dropping hot wax into water

By nails reflecting the rays of the sun

By walking in a circle

By red hot iron

By passages in books

A balanced hatchet

A suspended ring or the mode of laughing

Pebbles drawn from a heap

One of these things

Will tell you something

Let's tell the future

Let's see how it's been done

By numbers, by mirrors, by water

By dots made at random on paper

By salt, by dice

By meal, by mice

By dough of cakes

By sacrificial fire

By fountains, by fishes

Writings in ashes

Birds, herbs

Smoke from the altar

Let's tell the future

Let's see how it's been done

Let's see how it's been done

Let's see how it's been done
