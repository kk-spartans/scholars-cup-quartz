When something catches fire, mostly because of these:

## Thermal Ignition

Heat alone causes the reaction. Paper or wood igniting when exposed to a flame or hot surface.

## Self-Ignition (Spontaneous Combustion)

Material ignites without an external flame or spark. Oily rags oxidizing and catching fire on their own.

## Electric Ignition

Electricity triggers ignition. Electric matches in pyrotechnics.

 - **Autoignition** - The temperature where a material just *goes up* without a spark. ^90312d
 - **Catalytic ignition** - Surface catalysts lower the activation energy so fuel burns at lower temps (catalytic heaters).
 - **Pyrophoric ignition** - Certain materials (phosphorus) ignite on contact with air.
 - **Hypergolic ignition** - Fuels that ignite instantly on contact with an oxidizer (rocket fuel pairs like hydrazine + nitrogen tetroxide).
