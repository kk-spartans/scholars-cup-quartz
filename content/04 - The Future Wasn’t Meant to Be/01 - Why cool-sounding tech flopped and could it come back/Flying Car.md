20th-century dream of cars that could drive on roads and fly in the air. Promoted by inventors like Molt Taylor in the 1940s and 50s, with prototypes like the Convair Model 118.

Idea was to skip traffic and commute in straight lines. In reality, flying is hard, licensing is harder, and combining car and plane made both worse. Too costly and impractical for mass use.
