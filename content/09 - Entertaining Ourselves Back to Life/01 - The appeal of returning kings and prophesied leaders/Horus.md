Egyptian sky-god, usually shown as a falcon or a man with a falcon head. Son of Osiris and Isis, he avenges his father and fights Set for the throne of Egypt; that feud explains a lot of pharaonic symbolism. His “Eye of Horus” became a talisman for protection and healing. Myth mixes politics and religion here: pharaohs claimed Horus’s favor to justify rule.
