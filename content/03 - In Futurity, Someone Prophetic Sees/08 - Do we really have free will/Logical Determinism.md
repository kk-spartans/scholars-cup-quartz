I say “OpenAI’s open weight AI model will launch next week”. That statement is either true now, or it’s opposite is true. <strike>In this case, the opposite is true.</strike> [OpenAI just launched gpt-oss!](https://openai.com/index/gpt-oss-model-card/)

So, the future is predetermined because a something can happen or not happen (I don’t get this either).
