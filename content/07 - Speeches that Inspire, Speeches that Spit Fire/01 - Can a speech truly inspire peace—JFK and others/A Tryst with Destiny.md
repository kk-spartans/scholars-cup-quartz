This was the speech at midnight of India’s independence. Mostly a rant about how even though India is free, you need hard work like ending poverty, disease, ignorance, inequality, etc.

This speech is idealistic, but definitely not naive like Robert Menzies’. Not very inspirational to me right now, considering the current state of India.
