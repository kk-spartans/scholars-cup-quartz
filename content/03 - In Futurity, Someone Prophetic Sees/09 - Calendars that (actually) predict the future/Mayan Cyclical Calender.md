## Tzolk'in (Sacred Calendar)

260 days in total, made of:

 - 13 day numbers (1 to 13, basically weeks)
 - 20 day names (Imix, Ik’, Ak’bal, etc.)

Used for rituals, divination, naming kids, etc.

## Haab’ (Solar Calendar)

(Refer to [[03 - In Futurity, Someone Prophetic Sees/09 - Calendars that (actually) predict the future/Aztec Agricultural Calendar]] for rules)

Used for agriculture and civil life.

## Calendar Round

The Haab’ and Tzolk’in overlap every 52 Haab’ years (18980 days). Everyone got a new calendar at this point, and they did have 18980 day long calendars (~ 52 years)

## Long Count

(gpt4o #ai generated)

- Used to count big time spans (think: history books).
- Based on base-20 (vigesimal) and base-18 math.

**Time units:**

- 1 **K’in** = 1 day
- 1 **Winal** = 20 K’in = 20 days
- 1 **Tun** = 18 Winal = 360 days
- 1 **K’atun** = 20 Tun = 7,200 days (~19.7 years)
- 1 **Bak’tun** = 20 K’atun = 144,000 days (~394.3 years)

So a Long Count date like `13.0.0.0.0` is:

- 13 Bak’tuns
- 0 K’atuns
- 0 Tuns
- 0 Winals
- 0 K’ins  
= The mythical end date in 2012 (because 13 was sacred and mayan long count started in August 11, 3114 BCE)

Advanced inscriptions often add:

- Lunar cycles (moon age, lunation number)
- Lord of the Night (9-day repeating cycle)
- Planet positions sometimes
