- I wake up in my bed, jolted by my *digital* alarm clock — the kind with red LED numbers. My mattress is actual cotton or that new "memory foam" stuff my parents won’t shut up about.

- I walk into the living room and see our flatscreen TV — yeah, it’s only a few inches thick, like a fat magazine, and *not* one of those giant tube monsters. Our house? Pretty normal, got central air and everything. Feels futuristic enough.

- I brush my teeth with a normal toothbrush and Crest. Then I take a bath or a shower, thanks to the miracle of indoor plumbing and hot water on tap.

- I eat breakfast. Usually cereal. Sometimes Pop-Tarts. Milk from a carton. Revolutionary stuff.

- I step outside and see office buildings scraping the sky, AC units buzzing, and streetlights everywhere. Infrastructure, baby.

- I hop on the bus — it runs on diesel, probably. Some are hybrids now, which is wild.

- I go to school, where we’re just starting to learn stuff like “Computer Science.” It's this newish class where we get to play with BASIC or maybe C++. We think it's super advanced.

- I get back on the bus and head home, probably listening to my iPod or CD player.

- Now I get to mess around on the family computer, maybe dial up the internet (if nobody’s on the phone) and check out this brand new site called YouTube. Coding? Yeah, I’m messing with HTML and pretending I’m a hacker. Everything is encrypted with math I only kind of understand and runs through cables thicker than my GameCube controller cord.

- I go to sleep, leaving my stereo or boom box playing some burned mix CD or the radio. Life is good.
