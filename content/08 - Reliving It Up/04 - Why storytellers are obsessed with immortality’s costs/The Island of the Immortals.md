- A traveler visits the Yendian Plane, curious about rumors of immortals. Locals warn them not to go—the island is dangerous because of the flies.
- Old accounts describe the flies as harmless but tied to “immortality.” The locals, however, treat the idea with disinterest and even shame.
- The traveler arrives and finds the island a depressed, decaying place. Former hotels and diamond hunters’ lodges are abandoned. The people wear mesh suits to avoid fly bites.
- In a nearby village, they are shown “the Immortal”: a blind, legless, burned, ruined figure, centuries old, kept alive by one family out of duty and for tourist money. It can’t die, but it also can’t live in any meaningful sense.
- Over millennia, immortals eventually harden into strange black or clear diamond-like lumps—treated as “souvenirs.” The implication is that the “diamonds” the hunters seek are actually the final remains of immortals who’ve suffered for ages.
- The flies that confer immortality are almost impossible to avoid, but apparently only one is truly infectious. Nobody wants to risk becoming like the Immortal, so the people accept mortality and avoid the flies.
- The narrator leaves, shaken, realizing immortality here is not a gift but an endless mutilated survival—a horror of never being able to die.
