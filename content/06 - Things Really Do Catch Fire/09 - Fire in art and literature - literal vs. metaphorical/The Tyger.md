I really wish this would be as simple as “This is a wildlife report about a glowing, molten tiger”. I feel like the “fearful symmetry” and the “dread hand” stuff elevates the “tiger” to a cosmic level.

I feel like the lamb symbolized not knowing, and the tiger is experience. This is very metaphorical.
