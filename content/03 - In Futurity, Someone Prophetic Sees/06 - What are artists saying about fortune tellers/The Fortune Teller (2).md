The coin that’s in the fortune teller’s hand is either stolen, or payment — it’s hard to see. The people in the background look concerned by the looks of their faces.

I feel like they’re concerned of the work that the fortune teller is doing. Even the person who’s receiving the fortune telling has a doubtful look.

I think the artist is trying to convey that we should be doubtful of people who claim to know the future, as they could be thieves.
