generated by gpt4o #ai because i was lazy:

- I wake up to the rooster’s screaming—no clocks, no mercy. The bed’s a wooden frame with a straw-stuffed mattress that smells faintly of damp barn. Every time I roll over, it sounds like I'm sleeping on a bag of potato chips.

- I leave the sleeping room and head to the hearth. No parlor, just a one-room cabin or maybe two if we're fancy. Fire’s already burning if someone beat me to it. If not, it's flint, steel, and finger-crossing.

- I wash my face in a basin with water drawn from the well and left out overnight. It’s colder than betrayal. No toothpaste—just a cloth, maybe some salt or charcoal if we're flush.

- Breakfast is what there is—cornbread, maybe bacon if the pig cooperated this month, and black coffee boiled until it fights back. No cereal. Cows get that.

- I head outside. Dirt roads. Horses. Maybe a wagon rolling past. Neighbors are a mile away if we’re lucky. Everyone smells like woodsmoke and whatever animal they most recently wrangled.

- If I go to school, it’s a walk. Miles, usually. Through mud, fields, and whatever weather is currently trying to kill me. Schoolhouse is one room, one teacher, and a terrifyingly large switch.

- At school, we cover reading, writing, arithmetic. No geography unless we’ve got a map—and that’s usually one drawn from memory. Slates for work, and recitation until your lungs give out.

- I walk home again, dodging cow pies and trying not to think about how the sun’s already setting. No streetlamps, just stars and maybe a lantern if I remembered it.

- Back home, I do chores. Feed the animals, chop wood, carry water. If I’ve got five minutes, I read by candlelight—if I know how to read—and the Bible’s probably the only book in the house.

- I go to bed once the fire dies down. House creaks, wind howls, and if the shutters hold, I won’t wake up with snow on my face. Rats aren’t in the walls. They’re just... around.
