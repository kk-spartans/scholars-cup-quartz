> Reconstruct, reimagine, reignite: consider the [works of David Irvine](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/aug/03/david-irvine-upcycled-thrift-store-paintings-in-pictures) as examples of how new art can be made from old things, even those found in thrift stores. Will the future be built from bits of the past, or from materials we haven’t even imagined yet? What would you prefer to see?

The future won’t be built from stuff that’s there right now, that’s probably true. But the distant future can be built from materials in the near future if we want it to — just produce easy to repurpose stuff.

And I would like to see a world where everything looks like it *is* new — I have no take on whether it should be new.
