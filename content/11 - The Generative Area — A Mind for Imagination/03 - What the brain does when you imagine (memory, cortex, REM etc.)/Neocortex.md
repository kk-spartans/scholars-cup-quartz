The neocortex is the outer brain layer responsible for higher-order thinking, planning, abstract reasoning, and sensory integration. It coordinates imagination, memory, and prediction.

If neocortical function is disrupted, imaginative ability weakens. People may struggle with complex scenarios, abstract fantasy, or foresight. Imagination might become rigid, concrete, or emotionally muted, affecting storytelling and problem-solving.
