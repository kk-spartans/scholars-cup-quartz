- Willie looks 12 years old forever, but he was actually born 43 years ago.
- He “adopts” parents—living with lonely couples who want children—for a few years at a time, until people start noticing he never ages. Then he has to leave and find a new town, a new “mom and dad.”
- He’s kind and earnest, but also trapped—condemned to play the role of a child forever, even though inside he’s an adult with adult loneliness.
- At the end, he boards another train, heading to start the cycle over again in a fresh town, burdened but resigned to his strange existence.
