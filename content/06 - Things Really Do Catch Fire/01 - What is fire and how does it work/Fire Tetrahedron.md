Basically the [[06 - Things Really Do Catch Fire/01 - What is fire and how does it work/Fire Triangle]] but with “chemical chain reaction” added.

You might ask:

## “How Do You Remove The Chemical Chain Reaction In A Fire Without Removing Anything else?”.

Well that’s *exactly* how [halons](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Halon&oldid=1270044172) work.

### Normally, A Fire Would Look Something Like This:

> H• + O<sub>2</sub> → OH• + O• → more reactions → fire continues

(• means the substance is a radical, it has an unpaired electron. Radicals are **insanely** reactive because that lonely electron *really* wants a buddy, so it’ll grab the first thing it can — often violently.)

### But With A Halon Present:

> H• + Br<sub>2</sub> → HBr + Br•  
> OH• + HBr → H<sub>2</sub>O + Br•

Now you’ll ask:

## Then Why Don't We Use This To Extinguish All Fires?

We *did*. Halons were the hot stuff (literally) for decades — airplanes, server rooms, tanks, spacecraft, even datacenters used them. They were the “perfect” extinguisher:

- Didn’t leave residue (unlike water/foam/powder).
- Stopped fire instantly by nuking the chain reaction.
- Didn’t need to suffocate people in the room (unlike CO₂).

Bromine and chlorine radicals don’t just kill fire radicals, they also shred stratospheric ozone like toilet paper. Halons turned out to be *hundreds to thousands of times* more destructive per molecule than even CFCs. Once that was known, they got banned under the [Montreal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Montreal_Protocol&oldid=1306082706).

Now:

- Halons are still used in *very specific places* where nothing else is as effective (like some military aircraft, submarines, spacecraft, where a few seconds matter and you can’t soak stuff in water).

- For everywhere else, we swapped to “clean agents” (FM-200, Novec 1230) that are less effective radical scavengers but way less damaging environmentally. They usually work by a combo of mild heat absorption and a bit of radical interruption.
