> Explore the [history of broadcasting](https://medialooks.com/articles/the-evolution-of-broadcasting-from-the-airwaves-to-the-digital-age/) and mass communication. How does technology impact the effectiveness and reach of speeches, news, and entertainment programs? Be sure to explore the following historically significant examples and discuss: how did technologies (new or repurposed) make each of them possible, and could they have worked in different mediums? For instance, would FDR’s fireside chats have been as effective if delivered over the Internet?

Most of these things won’t work on the internet because either:

 - The collective ritual would be lost (Churchill)
 - People would make conspiracy theories (Apollo 11, just spacex did it better)
 - It wouldn’t have been a fair fight (Nixon would’ve had a ring light and a makeup artist on youtube)
 - Wouldn’t have that “Did you hear what happened last night?” (“Miracle On Ice”)

Jazz hour might work, and Eurovision/Intervision is already live on half the internet.
