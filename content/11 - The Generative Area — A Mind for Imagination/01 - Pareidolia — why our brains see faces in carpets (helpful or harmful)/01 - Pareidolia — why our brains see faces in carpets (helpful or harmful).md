> During a difficult conversation, you look down and see what looks like a giraffe in the carpet. This phenomenon—the human brain’s ability to find patterns and images even where none exist—is called pareidolia. Research how pareidolia works. Then discuss with your team: would humanity be better off if we only saw what was literally in front of us? When does pareidolia most hurt us—and when does it most help us?

Pareidolia fuels creativity, art, and innovation —seeing connections that “aren’t there” is how science often happens.

But it also leads to misinterpretations, superstition, conspiracy theories, and ghost sightings — our brains insist on finding faces in clouds or Jesus in a QR code.
