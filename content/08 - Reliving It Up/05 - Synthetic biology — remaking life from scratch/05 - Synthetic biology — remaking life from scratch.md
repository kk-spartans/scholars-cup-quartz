> In 2002, researchers in the United States were able to reconstruct the polio virus from scratchâ€”from [materials they ordered in the mail](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/12/research.internationaleducationnews). Explore the emerging field of [synthetic biology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/synthetic-biology), then discuss with your team: how might advances in this field help you and your loved ones in the future? What does it mean to synthesize a thing, versus simply to make it? And what future applications of synthetic biology can you imagine existing outside the human body?

Synthetic Biology: bioengineering, but instead of just tweaking existing organisms, you design and build completely [new parts or whole organisms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0_q-fD_lyU).

Making things is assembling already existing parts, synthesizing is *generating the parts*.

This could be used in:

 - Healthcare (imagine cooking up personalized vaccines in hours)
 - Food (lab grown meat)
 - Electricity...? (bacteria that pump out biofuels)
 - Cleaning the environment (microbes that eat oil spills and plastics)
 - Space exploration (bacteria that photosynthesize with light frequencies we want and respire almost nothing)

To help people, this could go miles.
