Should creators broadcast their work in progress? In my opinion, yes.

That way, fans feel involved, they cheer for you. Every time he released a saga, fans were ready with visuals, theories, and art. That’s insane loyalty.

Just make sure you don’t get into more legal trouble than the internet archive in the process.

Also, if you die, we get more of your stuff into the public domain without your record or estate having to publish it.

## WSC Guidelines

## YES.

If you did livestream every outline draft, we would’ve had more time to prepare and less worrying if we can hit the deadline for the global round we’re going to.

If you did livestream every outline draft, we could’ve given you culturally relevant recommendations to add to the guiding questions.

So — livestream the outline drafts. *please?*
