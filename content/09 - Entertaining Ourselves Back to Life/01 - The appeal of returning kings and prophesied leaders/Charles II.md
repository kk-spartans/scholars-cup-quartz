“The Merry Monarch” who returned England to monarchy in 1660 after the long Commonwealth interlude. His reign felt party-ish: culture revived, courts got theatrical, but he also presided over crises like the Great Plague (1665) and the Great Fire of London (1666). Pragmatic, pleasure-friendly, and politically skilled at survival rather than reform. Notorious for numerous mistresses and illegitimate kids; dynasty drama = chef’s kiss.
