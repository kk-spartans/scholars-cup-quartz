The Metonic cycle is a 19-year period after which lunar phases repeat on the same solar dates. Super useful in lunisolar calendars (Hebrew, Chinese, Computus) where you want moon phases to sync with solar years for festivals and holidays.

Over 19 years, there are almost exactly 235 synodic months. So, after 19 solar years, the moon will be full *on the same date* as it was 19 years ago (give or take a few hours). It’s not perfect, but close enough for calendar alignment without NASA-level math.

- 1 Metonic cycle = 19 solar years ≈ 6939.6 days
 - = 235 synodic months (≈29.53 days each)
