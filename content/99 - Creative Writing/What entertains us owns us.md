According to capitalism, **attention is currency.** According to us, we’re broke and still spending.

‘What entertains us owns us’ sounds dramatic, but check your screen time before you disagree. You are money (mostly), time is money, and your entertainment is taking your time.

Instagram knows what makes you laugh, youtube knows what you’ll watch when sleep deprived. Netflix drops a new show and suddenly your emotionally distressed towards a man who sells meth.

This very closely relates to the explanation of social media algorithms in the next essay. Big tech knows every single thing you do and think of more than yourself.

You’re not even choosing it, you think *you* clicked the video - but it was the **5th** time that the algorithm served it.

We like to think we own our attention, but we rent it to whatever’s loudest, funniest, or has the best hook in the first three seconds. If it keeps us watching, it keeps us. Period.

Even emotions are outsourced now. Scared? Horror movie. Lonely? Rom-com. Empty? 47-episode anime arc. Your feelings are managed like a playlist — curated for engagement.

You say you’re not addicted, but you know the plotlines of 14 shows, can quote entire memes, and can’t sit through dinner without checking your phone. You don’t follow trends — they *puppeteer* you.

It’s not evil. It’s not good. It’s just there. Feeding us, shaping us, keeping us fed on a diet of scrolling, laughing... forgetting.
