> In Isaac Asimov’s *Foundation* series, the great Galactic Empire is falling. Thirty thousand years of darkness and ruin await—even Palpatine couldn’t have lived that long—until a man who can predict the future using math comes up with a weird plan: a colony of librarians who, if left alone on the fringe of the known universe to write a great encyclopedia, could shorten the Dark Ages to a “mere” thousand years. Discuss with your team: would librarians be a good choice of profession for those entrusted to restart a great civilization? If not librarians, then who? And how much do you think math—and big data—can and should be used to predict the future?

Two words — the [Internet Archive](archive.org). They archive ***everything***; physical and digital. They have tankers filled with physical donated books, dvds, cds, anything rare or unique. And walls of data centers filled with tape, hdds, and ssds.

Anything from youtube in 2009 to an old ms dos CD from the 1990s, they have it if someone uploaded or donated it.

Librarians mostly do the same, but not at the same level — I feel like this profession should be left to archivists.

Math to predict the future? I guess if you have the state of every particle in the universe and a quantum computer the size of Jupiter, you could predict the future with just math.

And weather forecasts use math, technically. Even AI inference is just math. And we can predict the stock market, epidemics, social media trends all from previous patterns.

But if you’re goal is to **rebuild civilization**, you should probably get some of every single profession, because civilization right now has that.
