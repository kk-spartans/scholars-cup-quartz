> Not long ago, the future beckoned with open arms. Many people at the beginning of the 20th century–and even at its conclusion!–were certain that social and technological progress would continue endlessly, that there was a kind of Moore’s Law for everything. (At least one influential thinker [still believes this](https://aiadventures.net/summaries/moores-law-for-everything).) Consider the musical selection “[Counting Up to Twenty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMYtFe8adKA)” as just one example of this boundless optimism. In those not-so-long-ago times, forecasts for the future were exuberant—and sometimes even exuberantly dull. How do you see the future, and how does your view compare to that of the older people in your life?

I **completely** disagree with the thought of Moore's Law never ending. Maybe it will go on for a long time — but it will never "never end".

This is simply true because of the laws of physics, and while I think Sam Altman did a great job shaping AI, science proves him wrong:

 - You can never make a transistor that's smaller than about 0.5 nm because of Quantum Tunneling (electrons start moving out). And even with things like "Quantum Computing", it's not infinite compute.

 - Even if things get cheaper, Big Tech will hide that to reduce costs and increase profits.

I feel like Moore's Law will still apply for the rest of my life, and maybe my ancestors, but not forever.

I envision a future were the EU finally finished teaching Big Corps a lesson and our privacy and data is not threatened.
