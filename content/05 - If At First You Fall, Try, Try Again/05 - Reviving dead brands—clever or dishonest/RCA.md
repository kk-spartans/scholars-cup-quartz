The og RCA (Radio Corporation of America) was insanely huge in radio/tv. Was originally a patent pool owned by GE, Westinghouse, AT&T, and UFC. Became independent in 1932.

Got sliced in the 1980s, GE bought it in 1986 mainly for electronic. GE sold the record label to BMG, and the brand eventually disappeared.

Sony, BMG, and Technicolor used the RCA name for TVs, audio gear, and media products. All of them are just slapping the “RCA” name on it but nothing from RCA is actually there.
