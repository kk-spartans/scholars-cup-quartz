```
Turning and turning in the widening gyre   
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
```

A gyre is a spinning spiral, so things are spiraling wider and wider out of control. The falcon (humankind or society) can no longer hear the falconer (order, tradition, divine authority).

```
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere 
```

Chaos isn’t just creeping in — it’s flooding everything.

```
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst   
Are full of passionate intensity.
```

Everything which is in the present is wiped away, including the people who were like that.

```
Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.   
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out   
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
```

Surely this means something big is going to happen, the Second Coming — Christ will return. But the moment he says it, some dark vision comes to mind.

```
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert 
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
```

He sees the anti christ, not hope — something bad. This thing is dead eyed and merciless, it moves slowly while being unsettling.

```
The darkness drops again; but now I know   
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
```

The vision ended, but he’s seen too much. It’s been 2000 orderly years since christ was born, but now the “rocking cradle” is waking up a nightmare.

The era won’t be peace — it’ll be terror. It’s moving towards Bethlehem.
