> Volcanoes explode, and it’s not baking soda bubbling up inside of them. Explore the science of volcanic eruptions and study their consequences. Review the following cases and research: when and why do dormant volcanoes reawaken, and does human activity play a role? Also, what is an igneous rock?

An igneous rock is literally just cooled down magma, part of the rock cycle — eventually turns sedimentary and maybe metamorphic.

Dormant volcanoes reawaken because new magma rises from the deeper mantle, filling the chamber and pushing gases out.

Also because of tectonic shifts, which are mostly earthquakes and subduction. Even a little magma slowly accumulating can change pressure enough trigger an eruption.

Human activities do practically nothing here — geothermal drilling, and mining aren’t strong enough to trigger an entire dormant volcano on their own.

## How Volcanoes Work

(gpt5-mini generated)

1. **Magma formation:**  
    Deep in the Earth, rocks melt because of high temperature and pressure, or because water lowers the melting point. Magma is basically molten rock with dissolved gases (like H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>).
    
2. **Rising magma:**  
    Magma is less dense than the surrounding solid rock, so it wants to rise. Think of it like shaking a soda can—pressure builds and bubbles up.
    
3. **Volcanic eruption:**  
    When magma reaches the surface (or near it), gases escape violently, propelling lava, ash, and pyroclastic material out of the volcano.

---

- Magma is mostly silicates (SiO<sub>2</sub> + metals like Fe, Mg, Al, Ca).
- Dissolved gases include H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, HCl, HF.
- When lava erupts: SiO<sub>2</sub>-rich lava (rhyolite) is sticky → explosive eruptions.
- SiO<sub>2</sub>-poor lava (basalt) is runny → effusive flows.
- Gas + lava interaction can produce acids: SO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> (sulfurous acid) in the atmosphere.
