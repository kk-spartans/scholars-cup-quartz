> There is a long history of famous leaders traveling abroad to deliver speeches to audiences outside their own countries—sometimes to ask for help, sometimes to inspire. Consider U.S. President Barack Obama’s 2013 [speech to the people of Mexico](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/03/remarks-president-people-mexico), with special attention to the concluding paragraphs, then discuss with your team: would the prime minister in Love, Actually have cheered this speech—or criticized it? What would he have said about [this speech](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/thirteen-days-of-struggle-volodymyr-zelenskiys-speech-to-uk-parliament-transcript) by the president of Ukraine? What leaders from abroad would you like to have visit and speak in your own community?

## Obama’s Speech

The Love, Actually prime minister is basically allergic to flattery and soft focus “we’re all friends” rhetoric. Obama’s Mexico speech ends with a soaring “You are the dream. This is your moment.”

“That’s all very lovely, but the US actually wants something, and would bully to get it won’t it? How could the US say ‘we’re equals’ while having all the leverage?”

## Zelenskyy’s Speech

This, the PM from Love would like. Zelenskyy literally channeled Winston Churchill and Shakespeare while his country was being bombed.
