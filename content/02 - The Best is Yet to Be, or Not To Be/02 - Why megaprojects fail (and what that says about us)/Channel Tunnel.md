## What Happened Before

The idea of connecting the UK and France via an underwater tunnel had been floating around since the 1800s. Over the years, many versions were proposed — some involving horse-drawn carts, others powered by fans — but every attempt collapsed under the weight of politics, war, or someone panicking about invasion via mole-people. Ferries ruled the English Channel for decades, until in the 1980s both governments finally agreed to “let's do it, and let's not screw it up (to much)”.

## What Happened During

Construction began in 1988. Two tunnel boring teams, one French and one British, drilled towards each other under the seabed. Miraculously, they met in the middle, proving that international cooperation is possible when there's a lot of concrete and money involved. The budget ballooned from £4.6B to over £9B. Fires, floods, and almost biblical levels of red tape plagued the project. They finished in 1994 — six years late — and the first Eurostar train zipped under the sea, shocking people who were used to four-hour ferry delays and bad sandwiches.

## What Happened After

It works, and it works well. You can now travel between London and Paris in about two and a half hours without your feet ever touching salt water. That said, passenger numbers were initially underwhelming, maintenance costs are still high, and Brexit didn’t exactly make customs smoother. But the tunnel is still seen as a rare example of a mega-engineering feat that... kinda worked?
