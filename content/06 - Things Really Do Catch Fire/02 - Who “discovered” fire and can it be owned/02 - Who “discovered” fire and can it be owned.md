> Next, explore the history of fire. Was it discovered or invented, and by whom and when? How often is this history [revised](https://www.history.com/news/human-ancestors-tamed-fire-earlier-than-thought)? ([alternate link](https://archive.is/a8cjb)) Discuss with your team: if someone had first come up with fire in 2024, would they have been able to patent or copyright it? (And would it have been subject to international copyright laws?) Did anyone “own” fire in a similar way in the ancient world?

Maybe I’m just going insane — but if you ignore the fact that we couldn’t have developed enough to even come up with the idea of patents and copyrights without fire, it’s still not going to get accepted.

## Patents

But that doesn’t mean it’s against law, I read through

And **nowhere** does it say you can’t patent natural phenomena. I could patent gravity if I wanted to according to the US constitution, and I can patent fire because it contains matter or something...?

## Oh God, But The ***US Supreme Court* DEFINITELY CARES**.

(find the court opinion of this from *somewhere* [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/24), I don’t have that much free time)

In lots of places, the Supreme Court claimed you can’t patent natural phenomena.

 - “[For patents cannot issue for the discovery of the phenomena of nature](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/333/127#p4)”
 - “[A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented,](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep055/usrep055156/usrep055156.pdf#page=20)” <!--Did you know you could do that to pdf urls?-->
 - “[The laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas have been held not patentable](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep447/usrep447303/usrep447303.pdf#page=7)”
 - and more, which I don’t wanna find

## Copyright

And you can’t copyright fire, it’s a fact, and idea, a process, a system, and a method of operation at the same time — everything that can’t be copyrighted. Copyright is for creative work, not scientific discovery.

## Ancient World

(gpt5 #ai generated)

**Ownership in early societies:** In most ancient cultures, fire wasn’t owned in the way we think of property today. Tribes or clans shared it because survival depended on access—stealing someone’s fire could literally be life-threatening.

**Ritual and status:** Some societies treated fire as sacred. For example, Zoroastrians and ancient Romans had eternal flames maintained by priests or temple attendants. Controlling these fires conferred religious authority, not legal ownership.

**Technological control:** Even before formal law, controlling fire—keeping it alive, transporting it, starting it reliably—was a skill that gave power. Those who could manage it had a practical advantage, like cooking or protection, which sometimes created informal “rights” within a group.

**Conflict and sharing:** Myths and stories often reflect disputes over fire—like Prometheus in Greek mythology. These tales show that even without formal laws, fire was valuable enough to inspire rules, taboos, or social norms about who could use or handle it.
