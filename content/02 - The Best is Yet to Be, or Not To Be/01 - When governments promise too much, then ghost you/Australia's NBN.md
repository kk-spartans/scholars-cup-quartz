## What Happened Before

Before the prompise promise of actual wired fiber (or other) internet in Australia during the 2000s, they had to suffer with ASDL or Dail-Up. Want to load a plaintext website? You'd probably have aged a decade by then (sub 1 mbps speeds). Latency? Measured in geological time.

## What Happened During

In 2009, the government announced the National Broadband Network, which claimed the would've established direct Fiber-To-Premise connections to 93% of the population. Later, by 2013, they realized that they were too ambitious and revise their promise to be a "multi-technology mix", basically saying "let's use old copper wires, maybe some pigeons, cable tv lines, and cheap out on the fiber". They still delayed on this, and the costs balooned anyway. So, in 2025 most Australians are stuck with sub 20 mbps speeds while some people in the west are getting up to 10 gigabit.

## What Happened After

Even though the project was technically completed in 2020, most households are stuck with a mix of overwhelmed satellites, rotten copper wires, and frayed cable tv lines. Nice lesson I guess.
