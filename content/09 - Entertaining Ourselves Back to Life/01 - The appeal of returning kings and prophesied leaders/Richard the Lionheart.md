Century English king who actually preferred crusading and warfare to running his own kingdom. Famous for military skill and for spending so much time abroad that he barely governed England; he was captured returning from the Third Crusade and ransomed. Iconic as a chivalric warrior, but not exactly a domestic administrator. Died in 1199 from injuries at siege — heroic résumé, dubious HR record.
