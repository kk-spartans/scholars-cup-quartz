- **2005**: A podcasting startup called **Odeo** was co-founded by Evan Williams and Biz Stone.

- Apple dropped podcasting into iTunes, instantly nuking Odeo’s whole premise.

- So, they pivoted.

- Jack Dorsey pitched a side idea: an SMS-based “status update” service.

- They prototyped it, called it **Twttr**, then spun it off in 2006.

The idea wasn’t new—**Dodgeball** (acquired by Google in 2005) had done similar SMS status/location stuff.

**Dodgeball died. Twitter thrived.**  
Why? Timing + simplicity + open API + public feed = viral loop.

It seems like most startup companies nowadays are being bought by other, larger ones (like Meta, Elon Musk, Google, etc.) — twitter was different.
