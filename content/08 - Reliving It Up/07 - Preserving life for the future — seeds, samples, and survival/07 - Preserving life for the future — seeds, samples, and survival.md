> Noah might not have needed an ark if he’d had the Arctic. Stashed away above the Arctic circle, the Svalbard [Global Seed Vault](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/05/opinion/svalbard-seed-vault-climate-change/) is dedicated to preserving seeds from around the world to guard against extinction. Research it and [similar efforts](https://www.foodandwine.com/news/oreo-doomsday-vault-norway), then discuss with your team: how important is the preservation of living samples of today’s species for future generations?

The [doomsday vault](https://seedvault.nordgen.org/) is just a big backup of seeds from all over the world, it isn’t just for the future generation — current countries are claiming seeds from their land after wars to recoup their losses.

Syria claimed from here in 2015, because of the Syrian Civil War. And ICARDA wanted to regenerated some *allegedly* extinct plants.

Some other ones include:

## Global Oreo Vault

A place in Svalbard that holds all of oreo’s recipes, right down the road from the seed vault.

## Arctic World Archive

Digitized cultural and historical records, from mexico, brazil, and norway. Same mountain as the seed vault.

## Global Music Vault

Inside the AWA, has og quality recordings of music from across the world. Exists to protect the world from things like the universal studios fire. Stored as binaries inside super durable silica glass.

## Github Arctic Code Vault

A backup of every single github repo on 02/02/2020 (no commit history), which:

 - Has commits after 13/11/2019
 - Has atleast one star and has commits after 02/02/2019
 - Has atleast 250 starts (includes gh-pages and binaries >100KB for these)

Each repo was TARed, XZed and put into 186 QR encoded, compressed, [Piql film reels](https://piql.com/). It was 21TB of data.

A bunch of other stuff was also thrown in there, like:

 - All of Wikipedia then
 - All of Stackoverflow
 - Wiktionary
 - Wikispecies
 - The file formats archive
 - A bunch of other books

There’s also a [guide](https://github.com/github/archive-program/blob/master/GUIDE.md) to unpack the archive there along with [The Tech Tree](https://github.com/github/archive-program/blob/master/TheTechTree.md).
