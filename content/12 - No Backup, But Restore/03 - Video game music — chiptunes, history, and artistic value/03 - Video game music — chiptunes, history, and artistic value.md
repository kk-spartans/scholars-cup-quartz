> Blocks fall from above in various configurations as this [iconic music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCCQxVBfyM) plays: the Japanese composer Hirokazu Tanaka’s original soundtrack for Tetris is a classic of the genre. Discuss with your team: should we be creating more of this [chiptune music](https://www.synthcentric.com/articles/a-guide-to-chiptune-music) today? ([Alternate Link](https://web.archive.org/web/20250706105809/https://www.synthcentric.com/articles/a-guide-to-chiptune-music)) Continue your exploration of the history of [video game music](https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/level-up-the-evolution-of-video-game-music/), then discuss with your team: is video game music a legitimate form of art? And would music, and literature and art in general, benefit from more limitations such as those imposed by low-powered processors and audio capabilities on early video games—or from fewer?

- Pong (1972) – Literally just beeps. No music at all.
- Space Invaders (1978) – A four-note loop that got faster as enemies approached, partly because the CPU sped up when fewer sprites were on screen. ([[12 - No Backup, But Restore/03 - Video game music — chiptunes, history, and artistic value/Decoupling game logic from Framerate\|read]])
- Pac-Man (1980) – Tiny jingles at best; storage space was better spent on gameplay.
- Donkey Kong (1981) – A few seconds of looping melody; sound chips couldn’t handle more.
- Super Mario Bros. (1985) – Catchy as heck but limited to a few square and triangle waves.
- Tetris (Game Boy, 1989) – Hirokazu Tanaka’s iconic theme was literally squeezed into an 8-bit handheld’s sound chip.

In my opinion, we probably shouldn’t be creating chiptune music right now — it’s just an arbitrary limitation that makes artists less creative. 8-Bit remixes of old music is cool though, like [Your Love Is my Drug](https://open.spotify.com/track/1EoThnDm6kQfB2idIfR30n).

This should definitely be an actual form of music, words can’t explain this:

This would definitely be a legitimate form of art.
