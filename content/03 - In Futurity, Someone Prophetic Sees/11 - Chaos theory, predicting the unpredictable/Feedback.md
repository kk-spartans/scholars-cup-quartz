When the output of something is shoved back in as the input, along with the expected output. Either amplifying changes (positive feedback, like a mic screeching) or damping them down (negative feedback, like your thermostat).

For example,

- You want the room at 25 °C.
- Sensor measures 27 °C (the output).
- Controller goes “too hot,” reduces heater power.

Also, AI models love feedback, sometimes they literally beg for it, even on the API.
