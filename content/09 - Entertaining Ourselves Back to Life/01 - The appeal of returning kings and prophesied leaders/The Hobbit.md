The Hobbit — Bilbo Baggins, a comfy hobbit, is recruited by Gandalf and a band of dwarves to steal treasure from Smaug the dragon; along the way he finds a ring that’s way more important than anyone expects. It’s a picaresque adventure about growth, luck, and the small-person hero who outwits bigger threats. Lighter in tone than LotR but it seeds the darker mythology that follows.
