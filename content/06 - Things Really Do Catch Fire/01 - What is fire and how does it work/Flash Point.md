Really hard to understand; it’s the lowest temperature at which a liquid gives off enough vapor to ignite in the air if there’s a flame, spark or another ignition source nearby.

Fire point is basically flash point but it keeps burning even when you take the ignition source away (usually 10C - 40C depending on the liquid).

[[06 - Things Really Do Catch Fire/01 - What is fire and how does it work/Ignition#^90312d\|Autoignition]] temperature is the temperature at which a liquid will light itself, no help needed.

Basically,

 - **Below flash point** - won’t burn at all
 - **At flash point** - will ignite, might not continue to
 - **At fire point** - will stay on fire until one of the elements of the [[06 - Things Really Do Catch Fire/01 - What is fire and how does it work/Fire Tetrahedron]] is taken out
 - **Autoignition temperature** - will ignite on it’s own, without any external help.
