> Destroyed buildings can also have second leases on life. Consider the following examples, then discuss with your team: is a reconstruction of a building a continuation or something altogether new?

In my opinion, it depends. If the old building was completely destroyed, and nothing was left except memories — it’s something new.

But if it’s like the White House or Stonehenge, where it was never fully destroyed and you just reconstructed the broken parts, it’s a continuation.
