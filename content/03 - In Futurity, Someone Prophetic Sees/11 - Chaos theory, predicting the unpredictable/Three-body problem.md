<strike>Trying to predict how three orbiting objects interact is so complex it doesn’t have a general solution.</strike> 

People think it’s really complicated, but you can calculate 3 different bodies’ orbital paths around each other with a few thousand initial [[03 - In Futurity, Someone Prophetic Sees/11 - Chaos theory, predicting the unpredictable/Parameters]], and double precision on a consumer grade mid range gpu.

I can run a few thousand bodies and a few million steps in minutes on a consumer gpu with [REBOUND](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound), so this is mostly just skepticism.

But with 2 orbiting objects, it’s insanely simple and can run on microcontrollers.
