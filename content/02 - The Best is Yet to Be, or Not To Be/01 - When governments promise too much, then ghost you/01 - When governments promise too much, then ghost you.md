> In 2009, the Australian government announced an ambitious project to provide super-fast fiber-based Internet to 93% of the population; in 2013, it revised the plan to reuse existing copper wire; in 2025, many Australians [still have no (or slow) Internet](https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/23/australian_national_broadband_network_complete/). First promise big things, then revise the promise to make them little things, then don’t finish them anyway. This isn’t (we hope) a description of the World Scholar’s Cup curriculum release process, but a pattern of behavior for governments all over the world. Discuss with your team: is it better to underpromise and overdeliver, or vice versa?

So which was better?

Underpromising and overdelivering is obviously better — Look, if Australia failed (and they did), the public would (and does) hate them. <br> <br>

But if the wii or e-goverment failed, they could just say "waste of money" and have no PR damage. If they succeeded, it's positive PR and more money for them. <br> <br>

I'm ignoring the fact that all press is good press (kind of). <br> <br>
