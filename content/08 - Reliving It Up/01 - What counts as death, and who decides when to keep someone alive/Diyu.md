The Chinese underworld, run by King Yama and a bunch of demon bureaucrats. It’s not permanent death — it’s a stop in the reincarnation cycle.

You go through different “courts” where you’re judged for sins, then punished accordingly. Eventually, you drink the Meng Po soup (which makes you forget past lives) before reincarnation.
