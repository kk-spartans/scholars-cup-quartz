> “Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'” quipped the 2010 hit song “[If I Die Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NJqUN9TClM)”. Consider the other now-famous dead people below and discuss with your team: what is the best way to reignite someone’s legacy? Vincent van Gogh, for instance, only became famous after his death thanks to [the people in his life](https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/art-and-stories/stories/the-woman-who-made-vincent-famous). Should we focus more on studying the works of those who are still alive, or does a creator’s death make their creations more interesting in some way?

Playbook for reignition:

 - Publish and translate

But I still feel like studying living artists works better, because you can interview them and correct misconceptions. It’s also more relevant, more ethical, and makes the artist themselves see and feel their fame.

But death makes things more interesting every time because there’s a scarcity of new content from that person (XXXTENTACION and Juice WRLD), and also narrative power.
