Convex (thicker in the middle) lenses focus light towards a point, light is energy, energy can be heat — and heat starts fires.

Point these lenses towards something flammable (dry wood), and it’ll catch fire eventually with a sharp enough lens and a bright enough sun.

Lenses work by refracting light using optical glass (made for consistent refraction).
