Rigid airships invented by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin in the early 1900s, used for luxury travel, advertising, and wartime reconnaissance.

Offered long range and scenic flight, but disasters like the Hindenburg in 1937 (which was because of *desperation*, not ignorance) and the rise of faster airplanes killed mainstream use.

Last one died (Hindenburg) because of Germany using hydrogen as the gas to make the ship buoyant — even though they *knew* helium was safer. The US controlled most of the helium supply back then and refused to export it. And they went “well, hydrogen is cheap, buoyant, and we’ll just be really careful”.

“Really careful” didn’t turn out to be an actual fire safety plan.
