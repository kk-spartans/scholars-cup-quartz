> Research drugs that stimulate the imagination, then discuss with your team: should all these be considered illegal hallucinogens? Be sure to consider how and to what degree a hallucination varies from a simulation, a rehearsal, or other acts of the imagination. For instance, when is a daydream a hallucination?

The 4 main drugs that stimulate creativity are Caffeine, Alcohol, Marijuana and Psilocybin.

A hallucinogen is a drug that produces *major* alterations in thought, mood, and perception. None of this (except maybe alcohol and marijuana) produces *major* alterations, maybe minor.

If you’re telling me coffee is supposed to be an illegal hallucinogen, I’ll tell you water is a steroid that’s banned in the olympics.

## Different Forms Of Imagination

 - Hallucination — Your brain generates sensory experiences (sights, sounds, smells, etc.) with no external input. You perceive it as real.
   -  “That dragon in my living room is actually there.”

 - Simulation — Your brain runs a mental “model” of reality or a scenario, often to predict or plan.
   - “If I take that job, I’ll probably hate my boss. Let me run through that.”

 - Rehearsal — You practice actions or conversations in your head.
   - “If I take that job, I’ll probably hate my boss. Let me run through that.” (again, yes)

 - Dreams — Sleep’s chaotic remix of memories, emotions, and random neural firing. Lucid dreams are like having a director’s cut. Happens mainly in REM.
   - “I was in a mall, but it was also my childhood home, and the cashier was a horse.”

A daydream isn’t a hallucination because you (hopefully) know that whatever you’re imagining isn’t real — if your mental movie starts bleeding into your perception of reality and you can’t distinguish it, that’s hallucination.
