> Some people’s fingers whirl across the screen tapping and flicking with uncanny efficiency; others hesitate, or aim and miss, or fire at things that aren’t there. Rhythm games are a great source of entertainment, but they can also help people with injuries—or even brain damage—rebuild their [motor and mental skills](https://www.mcgill.ca/spl/files/spl/begelfhn2017.pdf). Consider their broader [history of rhythm games](https://splice.com/blog/history-rhythm-games/), learn more about (and hopefully play!) the examples below, and then discuss with your team: how could rhythm games be used in schools for educational purposes? What kind of rhythm game would you design if you wanted to create a popular product? And could rhythm games be changing how future music is composed and appreciated?

## Schools

Rhythm games are literally built in engagement machines. Instead of ugly, raw memorization — imagine students learning the types of rocks and french conjugation by clicking on beats with a song to go with them.

---

In my opinion “gamified learning” is a market more dead than VR. I just don’t feel like the current state of these “games” abstracts learning away enough.

“This quiz now has power ups and boosters that give you more points”

So? That’s just an MCQ with more RNG, I’m already just choosing random things.

## Game Design For Mass Appeal (aka: let’s Burn money)

For this to be a silicon valley hit, we’ll:

 - Build it with electron for desktop, because why use efficient native code when we can ship a 500 MB installer with 400 npm dependencies and 20 critical vulnerabilities out of the box.
 - For mobile? React Native, duh. Nothing says “buttery-smooth rhythm game” like a JavaScript bridge choking on every frame.
 - The music library will be user-generated, which means players will spend more time arguing about copyright than actually playing.
 - Procedural beat-mapping will be “AI-driven” (read: ChatGPT guessing where the beat is).
 - Online play will include ranked leaderboards that break every update, and yes, there will be a $5/month subscription to unlock “Hard Mode.”
 - Visually, think Just Dance meets Beat Saber, but also Duolingo — because we’ll guilt you with notifications until your thumbs cramp.

## Influence On Music

Rhythm games are already nudging music forward:

- Producers are writing high energy, rhythmically complex tracks for games like osu and beat saber.
- Songs are being composed with visual patterns in mind — drops timed for striking gestures.
- Gamers develop sharper rhythmic intuition, so future music could be more syncopated and interactive. This feedback loop could push music to be more physical, designed to be played, not just heard.
