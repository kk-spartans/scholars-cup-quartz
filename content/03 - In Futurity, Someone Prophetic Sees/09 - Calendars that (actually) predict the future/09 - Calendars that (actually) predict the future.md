> Not all methods of foretelling the future are rooted in superstition or ritual; some stem from long-term observations and lived experiences. For example, the [Chinese agricultural calendar](https://www.scmp.com/yp/discover/lifestyle/article/3205168/chinese-agricultural-calendar-ancient-people-combined-lunar-and-solar-years-know-when-plant-harvest) is based on centuries observing the weather and the movement of celestial bodies. The result is a calendar that [reliably predicts](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/12/1198909292/lunar-new-year-chinese-lunisolar-calendar-history) the movements of the sun and moon, ocean tides, astronomical events, and the turning of the seasons—one still referenced by farmers today. Research the following and explore with your team: are there any other reliable not-quite scientific methods of predicting the future that merit continued study?

It predicts flu outbreaks before health reports by just seeing how often people search for “flu symptoms” or something like that.
