 - Someone predicts something, let’s say “The world will end in 2012”
 - People go insane (if the person is credible) and believe that this will come true. Maybe they buy food, water, and some sanity in bulk - now we have a supply shortage.
 - The world ends because of the supply shortage

If that (credible) person had never predicted that the world will end, this would’ve never happened. It **fulfills itself.**
