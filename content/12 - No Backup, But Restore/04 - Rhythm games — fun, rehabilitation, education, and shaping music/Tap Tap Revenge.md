Guitar Hero / Dance Dance Revolution but for your iPhone: a 2008 touchscreen rhythm game where colored notes slide down lanes and you tap them on the beat (and sometimes shake the phone for special moves). It launched in July 2008 and blew up fast.

Tapulous (the studio) was bought by Disney in July 2010, and Disney pulled the Tap Tap games and shut their servers in early 2014 — so you can’t get the originals from the App Store anymore.
