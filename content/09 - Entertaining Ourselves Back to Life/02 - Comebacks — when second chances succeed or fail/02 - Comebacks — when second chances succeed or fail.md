> When at first you don’t succeed, try and try again—and, likely as not, flop harder. Napoleon Bonaparte returned from exile in Elba as a self-reproclaimed emperor, only to drown in misfortune at Waterloo. Look into the following figures whose careers took off post-exile, then discuss with your team: why was their second wind better than their first? Can you think of other examples of individuals, like Napoleon, who attempted a comeback—but failed spectacularly?

People who failed their second try:

 - Tesla — the Roadster was a tech demo more than an actual car, the Model S was straight up cannibalism.
 - Thomas Edison — He failed almost 1000 times
 - Elon Musk — Zip2 was messy, X.com merged into PayPal... and let’s not talk about the early Tesla Roadster or the near-bankruptcy moments with SpaceX.
 - [[01 - Introductory Questions/04 - What does it mean to re-ignite/Myspace]] — Tried to pivot after facebook killed it, failed. Tried again with music, failed harder.
 - [[05 - If At First You Fall, Try, Try Again/05 - Reviving dead brands—clever or dishonest/Nokia]] — Dominated phones, failed with symbian, tried again with windows phones, died in mobile.

All this happens because comeback has a built in drama. The first act is just someone doing their thing. The second is them clawing back from failure, which makes people root for them (or atleast pay attention).

Napoleon’s second wind wasn’t “better”, it was louder. He escaped exile, rallied France in weeks, and scared Europe enough that they all dogpiled him at Waterloo. Even losing made him legendary.
