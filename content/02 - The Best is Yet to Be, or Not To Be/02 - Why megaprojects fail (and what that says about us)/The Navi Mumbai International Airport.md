## What Happened Before

Before the dream of a second major airport for Mumbai, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (mouthful) was actually suffocating to be in. Flights were delayed, passengers were carefully stacked like Tetris blocks, and expansion options were about as viable as building a runway next to the ocean. Navi Mumbai, with all its glorious empty-ish land, seemed like a no-brainer.

## What Happened During

The idea for Navi Mumbai International Airport? Floated way back in 1997. Approved in 2007. Construction? Kept getting pushed like your homework due tomorrow. Land acquisition dragged thanks to protests (the main reason for delays in India) and classic political drama. 

By the time they actually broke ground in 2018, it already felt like we were halfway to Mars. Even post-2020, delays kept piling up because *C***O*****V*****I***D*

## What Happened After

As of now (2025), the airport still isn't operational. It’s promised to open by 2025-end or early 2026, but no one’s trusting them (as usual). Meanwhile, Mumbai’s main airport is still dying internally, and Navi Mumbai’s shiny airport remains a very expensive construction site.
