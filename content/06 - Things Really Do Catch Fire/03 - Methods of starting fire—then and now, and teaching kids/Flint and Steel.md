A [Minecraft item](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Flint_and_Steel) used to set things on fire.

In real life, you just hold a piece of flint on one hand, and high-carbon steel on the other. Then, you strike the flint with the steel at a sharp angle.

Tiny steel particles shear off, friction heats them up to ~1200C. Use these glowing bits to burn anything flammable â€” char cloth, dry wood, paper, your skin.
