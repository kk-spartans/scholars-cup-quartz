(Dates shift slightly year to year, the earth doesn’t care about neatly drawn straight lines.)

This is based on the ecliptic, the Sun’s relative path around Earth. The zodiac belt lies here with 30 degree slices every time.

The Babylonians carved the zodiac system around 700 BCE. Greeks later slapped on their own names and ideas, thanks to Ptolemy.

## Why I Think it’s ‘fake’

Earth wobbles (precession), so the Sun isn’t *in* the same constellations it was 2000 years ago. But astrologers still use the old positions (I think).

## Not To Be Confused With

(gpt4o #ai generated)

- **Chinese Zodiac**: Based on birth year, 12 animals. It’s a completely different beast (literally).
- **Vedic (Indian) Zodiac**: Sidereal, adjusts for precession. More astronomically accurate.
