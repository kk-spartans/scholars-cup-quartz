Babylon was a living metropolis from the 3rd millennium BCE through the Neo-Babylonian peak under Nebuchadnezzar II, then fell into ruin and was quarried, looted, and altered for millennia.

20th-century archaeology excavated and exported major fragments (the Ishtar Gate panels in Berlin), and Saddam Hussein’s 1980s “revival” project rebuilt palatial features, created landscaping, and inserted modern monuments for nationalist pageantry — often at the cost of archaeological context.

Today’s site is part authentic ruins, part modern interventions and contested museum displays; because the original urban fabric and social context can’t be re-created.
