In international relations, the controlling state is usually the great power — and the client state is usually the small power and aligns with the interests of the controlling state. If it doesn’t — war.

Think Cold War:

 - USSR — controlling state.
 - East Germany, Cuba (to an extent) — client states.

In [react](https://react.dev), the parent state (or just a higher level component) owns the data and tells the child what it is. The child just reflects it back up when in changes.

In the client state, the component itself owns and manages its own data, without needing someone upstairs to dictate it.

*maybe they meant this??*
