## What Happened Before

Seoul, South Korea's current capital, was very, **very** congested. They needed to build a new self governing, administrative capital to fix that. This was back in 2003. They *hoped* people would move to their newly built city, but most couldn't even try to.

## What Happened During

Sejong was founded in 2007 as the new planned capital of South Korea. It was named after King Sejong the Great, the creator of the Korean Alphabet. The construction was supposed to go:

 - 2007-2015 — Initial phase
 - 2016-2020 — Self Sufficient phase
 - 2021-2030 — Full completion

They were supposed to wrap it up by 2030 with a final population of 500k~. They *kind of* are on track to do that, but it's a complete mess right now. They aimed for 20k~ residents by 2012, and 300k~ by 2020.

## What Happened After

Since 2012, the government of South Korea has relocated numerous ministries and agencies to Sejong, but many still reside in other cities, primarily Seoul, where the National Assembly and many important government bodies remain.
