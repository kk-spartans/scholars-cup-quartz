This thing is the Swiss watch of ancient Greece. It's a mechanical analog computer (built ~100 BCE) used to predict astronomical events like eclipses, lunar phases, planetary movements, and even the timing of the Olympic Games. It’s like if a Rolex and a planetarium had a baby.

It uses interlocking gears to model various astronomical cycles, including the Metonic cycle and the Saros. You’d crank a dial, and it would show you the positions of the sun, moon (with phase), and planets for any date. It even corrected for the moon’s elliptical orbit using a pin-and-slot gear to simulate varying speeds.

- Metonic cycle: 19 years / 235 lunar months
- Saros cycle: ~18 years / 223 lunar months
- Callippic cycle (4 Metonic): 76 years
