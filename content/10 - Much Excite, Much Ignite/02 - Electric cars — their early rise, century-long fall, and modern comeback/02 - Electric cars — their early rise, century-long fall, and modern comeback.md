> Long before Elon Musk’s Tesla, electric cars were already popular for their convenience, quietness, and lack of horse manure aroma. Electric cars were poised to dominate the twentieth century—and then they disappeared for a hundred years. With your teammates, explore the [invention and spread of early automobiles](https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/automobiles). ([alternate link](https://web.archive.org/web/20250221100501/https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/automobiles)) What happened to electric cars and what led to their return? What were some of the [key innovations](https://www.motortrend.com/features/biggest-car-technology-advancements-since-1949/) in automobiles? Have you ever gotten stuck inside a [self-driving taxi](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/la-man-nearly-misses-flight-as-self-driving-waymo-taxi-drives-around-parking-lot-in-circles/)? And, most importantly, where are our [flying cars](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flying-car-reality-technology)?

Electric cars were actually killing it in the early 1900s. They were quiet, clean (no gasoline stench, no horse poop either), and way easier to start than those crank-handle gas cars.

Then Henry Ford rolled up with the Model T in 1908, slashed gas car prices, and cheap oil made gas engines king. Add in the invention of the electric starter, better roads that required longer ranges, and the fact that early lead-acid batteries sucked, and electric cars basically disappeared until the 2000s.

They came back because lithium-ion batteries got good, oil prices spiked, climate change guilt hit hard, and Tesla made EVs “cool” instead of “golf carts for nerds.” Governments also threw subsidies at them.

## Key Innovations

- Automatic transmission
- Power steering and brakes
- Airbags and crumple zones
- Electronic fuel injection
- ABS, traction control, stability control
- Navigation and infotainment
- Hybrid/EV drivetrains
- ADAS and self-driving tech

## Self Driving Taxis

Mediocre at best. I feel like self driving cars are best when there’s a driver in the seat, in this world atleast.

I don’t understand how open source things like [openpilot](https://comma.ai/openpilot) are [sometimes better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdmxM-v4KQg) than proprietary things like google waymo.

When they stop randomly driving in circles, I’ll take them seriously.

The FAA and **DGCA** will explode if this happens. They can’t even prevent 2 planes from crashing into each other — what makes you think cars a better? (spoiler: they’re worse)

And we wouldn’t make these anyway — who do you think is paying for a flying go kart when they could *probably* get something that hits landspeed records for the same price?

Traffic isn’t really a concern now, people can do *almost* whatever they want in cars — listen to podcasts, watch netflix, play fortnite in the backseat, study for the scholar’s cup.
