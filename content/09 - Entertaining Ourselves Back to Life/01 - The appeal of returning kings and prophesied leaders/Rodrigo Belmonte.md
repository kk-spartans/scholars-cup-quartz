A fictional Jaddite war-leader from Guy Gavriel Kay’s *The Lions of Al-Rassan*, modeled loosely on El Cid. He’s a brilliant, honorable captain whose loyalties and friendships get torn between faith, country, and conscience as war looms. The novel uses his arc to explore how religion and politics corrupt and human relationships endure anyway. It’s tragic, elegiac fantasy grounded in medieval Iberian analogues.
