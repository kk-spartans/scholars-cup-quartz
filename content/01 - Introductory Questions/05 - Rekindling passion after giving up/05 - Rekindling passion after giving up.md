> There’s no denying that some things excite our passions. For some of you, maybe, World Scholar’s Cup is that kind of cause; others of you might thrill to the fight against global climate change, a big boss in the Forgotten Land, or the harmful impacts of social media. But what would it take to have your feelings about something (or somewhere or someone) *re-ignited*? Under what circumstances does a person leave a project, then return to it with new zeal?

This is a very opinionated question — and in *my* opinion, most people come back to a project when one of these things happen:

 - There's something that's new in that field that wasn't there when they left that could change their mind on it.
 
 - They made something on their own that they would like to share to the community in that field.

 - They changed their mind on leaving because they could've gotten *un*bored.

 - The moon turns blue.
