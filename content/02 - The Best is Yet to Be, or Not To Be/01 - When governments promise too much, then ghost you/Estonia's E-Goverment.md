## What Happened Before

In 1991, Estonia had just regained independence from the Soviet Union. Its economy was struggling, its bureaucracy was ancient, and its tech infrastructure was basically nonexistent. Paper ruled everything. It had no legacy systems — which was bad for getting started, but great for not having to untangle old junk. Other countries didn’t expect much — it was a tiny Baltic state with barely a seat at the global table.

## What Happened During

Instead of making big promises or flashy announcements, Estonia just… got to work. They invested in digital literacy, built secure national ID infrastructure, and launched basic online services in small steps. There was no “Digital Revolution” press tour — just quiet policy, clear standards, and consistent rollout. By the early 2000s, citizens could file taxes online in minutes. By the 2010s, they could vote from their phones. Everything from prescriptions to business registration became fully digital, and the systems *actually worked*.

## What Happened After

By 2025, Estonia is seen as a global leader in e-governance. While other countries are still pushing paper across desks, Estonia’s citizens can manage almost all state services with a digital ID — securely, from anywhere. They've even launched e-Residency, letting foreigners register Estonian companies without ever visiting. The project didn’t start with a big promise — but it ended up delivering something revolutionary, efficiently, and quietly.
