> “I did it again” isn’t always an oops; it’s often a plan. Many artists re-record and sometimes greatly revise and recreate their own past works. Taylor Swift’s new “Version(s)” of her old albums have set the charts on fire even though most of her songs are little-changed—but for some, her success has had [consequences](https://uclawreview.org/2024/03/27/look-what-you-made-them-do-the-impact-of-taylor-swifts-re-recording-project-on-record-labels/). Discuss with your team: what is the right time to re-release existing works, and to what degree should the original creator need to be involved?

The original creator probably doesn’t need much involvement in the making of a cover, other than just approving it. If the original creator is dead, I feel like the song should just be public domain at that point.

The best timing to re-release something is when there’s new interest, legal and financial incentive, or maybe even a cultural moment that makes work relevant again. Too soon, and it feels lazy; too late, and it loses impact.

Taylor Swift hit the sweet spot — her old albums had cult status, fan demand was high, and she had a legal motive.
