When people get obsessed with trends that happened 20 years ago. For example, in the 2010s everyone was weirdly cool with 90s flared jeans, Tamagotchis, etc. Now? People are fetishizing the early 2000s: flip phones, and low rise jeans.

Why romanticize 20 years ago? (gpt5 #ai generated <!--New model drop; yay! -->)

- **The people who were kids 20 years ago are now adults with disposable income.**  
    You loved Pokémon cards in 2004? Now you can blow rent money on a mint Charizard without asking your mom. Marketers *love* this.
    
- **You crave a “safe” past when adulthood feels chaotic.**  
    Your brain filters out the bad parts and remembers the cozy vibes—like Blockbuster movie nights, not the boredom or dial-up internet rage.
    
- **Trend cycles need novelty, but not *too* much novelty.**  
    20 years is just far enough that the styles feel “fresh” again to younger people, but still familiar enough that older ones won’t revolt.
    
- **Social media accelerates recycling.**  
    TikTok dredges up a song from 2003, Gen Alpha thinks it’s new, Millennials get all “omg my childhood,” and suddenly low-rise jeans are back.
