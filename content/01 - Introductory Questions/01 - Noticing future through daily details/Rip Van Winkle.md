Pretty Short Story, tl;dr:

Guy named Rip Van Winkle lives in the Catskill Mountains before the American Revolution. One day, he gets annoyed of his wife and goes squirrel hunting with his dog (Wolf, for some reason). After some time, he finds a man carrying a keg and asks him if he needs help.

He says yes, they talk for a while, get drunk and Rip goes unconscious. He wakes up again on a sunny morning, 20 years later - he was questioned again and again. His family thought he was missing, he had another kid with the same name and his wife died.
