I have one takeaway from this: “post-war Australia should not become socialist, because we should build a society where the middle class thrives”.

He is kind of naive over here, keeps romanticizing the “middle class”, underplays inequality by dismissing class struggle as a marxist distraction.

He also assumes independence is attainable by everyone, which was a bold claim. Also I feel like socialism was worse than fascism in his opinion, which is weird given the timing (1942).

So this speech is both inspirational and naive.
