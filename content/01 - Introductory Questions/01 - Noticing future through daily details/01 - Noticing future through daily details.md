> [[01 - Introductory Questions/01 - Noticing future through daily details/Rip Van Winkle]] slept for twenty years, [[01 - Introductory Questions/01 - Noticing future through daily details/Captain America\|Steve Rogers]] for seventy, [[01 - Introductory Questions/01 - Noticing future through daily details/Avatar The Last Airbender\|Aang]] for a hundred- in each case, with remarkably little impact on their health. (Rip Van Winkle did grow some facial hair.) Imagine that you went through something similar and woke up in the year 2120 (albeit with neither superpowers nor supercharged follicles.) How quickly do you think you’d notice you were in the future? Would beds feel different? Would chairs be strange shapes? Would there be funky new food in the fridge? Would there still be a Global Round in Bangkok? Outside your home, would you encounter a strange new society or one roughly like our own? Or would you encounter no society at all, just a picturesque (and probably terrifying) post-apocalyptic landscape?

To answer this question, I think we should start by looking at the differences between 1920 and 2020. Also, looking at people's predictions of the future 100 years ago would be nice to see what they did wrong and what we can do right.

Considering [[01 - Introductory Questions/01 - Noticing future through daily details/The Routine Right Now]], [[01 - Introductory Questions/01 - Noticing future through daily details/The Routine in the 1920s]], [[01 - Introductory Questions/01 - Noticing future through daily details/The Differences Between 1920 and Now]], and [[01 - Introductory Questions/01 - Noticing future through daily details/What People Thought The Future Would Be Like]]; I think there would be a few things that could happen in the future (Made by gpt4o #ai because I was lazy):

- **My routine is totally obsolete**. Not in a “floppy disks”, like “why were humans still touching toothbrushes?” Everything mundane is probably automated, embedded, or ambient. Beds will adjust themselves based on brainwaves or something spooky. Showers might just scan and clean you like you’re luggage at the airport.

- **Screens are gone.** Not replaced, *transcended*. Holograms, AR overlays, and neural links are probably how people watch cat videos now. You don’t scroll, you *experience* the algorithm in real-time brainspace.

- **Education is a USB stick away.** Or it’s beamed into your consciousness. Learning Computer Science might be as basic as learning the alphabet. What’s cutting-edge now might be kindergarten stuff then-AI ethics, interstellar economics, memetic warfare.

- **Transport? Practically teleportation.** If we haven’t cracked actual teleportation (because physics is rude), it’ll be hyperloops, self-driving pods, or drones carrying people like confused mail. Fossil fuels will be a curse word.

- **Society will feel alien**. Not because of flying robots, but because the *values* and *norms* will have shifted hard. Think fewer “nations” and more “networked communities.” Everyone speaks twenty languages-thanks, brain chip. You might say something completely normal and get banned from the future-internet for it.

- **Food? Either gourmet lab-grown molecular gastronomy or sad Soylent v22.1.** Possibly both. It’s either hyper-efficient or hyper-indulgent, depending on where you are on the social hierarchy ladder. (Which probably still exists, just now with extra dystopia.)

- **Environmentally?** Could go two ways: eco-utopia powered by algae and sunlight, or “the sun is outlawed and we eat mushrooms in bunkers.” Depends how well we play the climate game now.

There probably wouldn’t be a global round in bangkok though.
