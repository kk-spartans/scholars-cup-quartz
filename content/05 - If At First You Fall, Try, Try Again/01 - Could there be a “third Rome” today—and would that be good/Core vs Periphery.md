I feel like these shouldn’t compete — a world where we have core and periphery countries is probably healthy, if they shift every few dozen years.

 - A core country contains most the wealth
 - A periphery country contains the rest of the wealth (it’s peripheral, like a mouse or a keyboard compared to a computer)
