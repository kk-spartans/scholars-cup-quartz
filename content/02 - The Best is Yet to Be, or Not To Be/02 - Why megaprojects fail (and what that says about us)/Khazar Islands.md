## What Happened Before

Azerbaijan, basically printing oil money, wanted its own Dubai. An insane megaproject called the Khazar Islands was planned off the coast of Baku. It was going to include 41 artificial islands, a Formula 1 track, a yacht club, and the worldâ€™s tallest building. Why? Because Dubai did it.

## What Happened During

Construction started in 2011. Marketing was everywhere. The rich were buying in. Then the oil market crashed. All funding stopped, unfinished concrete shells were the only thing remaining.

## What Happened After

The project was basically abandoned. No tallest tower. No glittering islands. Just dust, unpaid debts, and the bitter taste of ambition meeting economic gravity.
