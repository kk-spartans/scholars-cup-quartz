A very old social check-in(ish) app that debuted in 2010, founded by Kevin Systrom. It's goal was to make people know where you were all the time and let them know when you arrive at (check-in) a place. It also featured other stuff like messaging between people and photo sharing.

Everyone hated most of the location sharing and messaging parts, but **photo sharing was insanely popular**. After Burbn died, the creator made Instagram.

Facebook later bought them when they had 30 million users, 13 employees, 0 revenue, and were 18 months old. They didn't have an android app until **1 week** before the acquisition â€” insane.
