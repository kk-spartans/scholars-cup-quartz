> It’s not as convenient as a wardrobe, but [_tensei_ stories](https://soranews24.com/2022/10/29/why-are-there-so-many-reincarnation-and-villainess-anime-and-manga-manga-editor-explains/) offer an alternative portal to fantastical worlds: death and reincarnation. Explore this genre and discuss with your team: what are some common themes in these works, and why might they be [so popular today](https://www.cbr.com/isekai-anime-reflect-modern-society-escapism/)? Could ours be the world that someone from another world be reincarnated in and perceive as fantastical?

I see 5 common themes over here:

 - Characters were losers, nobodies, and stuck in their old life — death wipes the slate clean.
 - Escapism.
 - Fulfilled wishes (overpowered, immediate clout)
 - Twists of villainess
 - Satisfaction of “look who’s winning now”

It’s popular because modern life is just flat. A lot of people are tired, lonely, and in endless cycles of school-home-sleep. This is a fantasy where you can literally *die* out of that grind and wake up somewhere exciting.

Our world could definitely be a fantasy for someone else. Imagine a medieval villager here:

 - Running water — black magic
 - Smartphones — alien technology
 - Planes — a metal tube yeeting itself into the sky at 900km/h
 - Internet — a dimension where you can summon infinite stupidity
