I have opinions on this — this entire album, not only the song, is basically cultural amplification. Curated collabs — Afropop, gqom, R&B, rap — shape a transnational sonic frame for Wakanda’s politics.

This is more of a political mixtape than a film score, one that pushes mainstream hip hop towards african sonic alliances.
