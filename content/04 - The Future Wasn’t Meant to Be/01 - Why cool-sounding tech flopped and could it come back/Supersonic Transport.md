Passenger planes exceeding Mach 1, most famously Concorde (1976–2003). Developed by UK/France and briefly by the USSR (Tu-144).

Promised faster-than-sound travel times, but high fuel use, ticket cost, and noise pollution from sonic booms doomed commercial viability.

The thing is, [Boom](https://boomsupersonic.com/) is trying to fix that — they exceed the sound barrier at a time perfect enough to bounce off clouds and not be audible to the ground.
