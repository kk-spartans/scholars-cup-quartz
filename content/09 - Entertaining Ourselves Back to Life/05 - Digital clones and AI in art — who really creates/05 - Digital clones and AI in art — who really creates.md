> In 2023, electronic music artist Porter Robinson created the “Po-uta” voice bank to allow future artists to create songs using his voice. Check out [this interview](https://www.vocaloid.com/en/creator/meets_001/) where he explains his motivations as well as the demonstration song “[Humansongs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqTq1P6y70Q)”. Similarly, some Hollywood actors are creating [digital clones of themselves](https://slate.com/technology/2023/06/screen-actors-guild-artificial-intelligence-strike-digital-doubles.html) with the help of AI—some to preserve their likeness for the future, others to accept multiple gigs at once. Explore these technologies with your team, then discuss with your team: when (and how much) does it matter whether an artwork is created by the artist themselves or their digital clone?

I have five things that matter over here:

 - Emotional response from the public (A porter robinson song sung by him carries more context and intent)
 - Artistic intent (If someone else used the clone, it doesn’t feel ok)
 - Perception (A painting by Van Gogh is priceless because it’s his hand, not a perfect AI copy.)
 - Practical use (Digital doubles can do things humans physically can’t)
 - COPYRIGHT

It matters most when the human’s intent, imperfection, or story is central. It matters less when the experience or aesthetic can be fully captured digitally.

If you want, I can sketch a quick **“spectrum of importance**
