Mazda gave these their fame (RX-7, RX-8). Skips pistons and cylinders, for a triangular-ish rotor that spins inside an oval-ish chamber.

Instead of moving up and down like a piston, the rotor turns, creating the intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust cycles all in one smooth spin.

Pros: super smooth, compact, high power-to-weight ratio.

Cons: burns more fuel, leaks oil more, and lifespan isnâ€™t as great as a normal piston engine.
