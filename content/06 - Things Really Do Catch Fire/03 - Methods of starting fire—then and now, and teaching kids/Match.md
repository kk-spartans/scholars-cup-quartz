A stick made of wood (or sometimes cardboard), with a head and a striking surface as a peripheral in safety matches.

It starts with friction by you striking the match, which created heat.

## Materials

### Mainly Made Of

 - **Red Phosphorus (chained P<sub>4</sub>)** — Friction turns a bit of it into [[06 - Things Really Do Catch Fire/04 - Greek fire and its modern equivalents/White Phosphorus]] (unchained P<sub>4</sub>), which is highly reactive
 - **Potassium Chloride (KClO<sub>3</sub>)** - Decomposes when heated, releasing oxygen (2KClO<sub>3</sub> → 2KCl + 3O<sub>2</sub>)
 - **Sulfur or antimony sulfide (for low temps)** - actual fuel

### Other Fuels

- Sulfur
- Antimony trisulfide
- Charcoal
- Phosphorus sesquisulfide (for strike-anywhere matches)
- Powdered Metals (especially Mg)

### Other Oxidizers

- Potassium perchlorate
- Sodium chlorate
- Potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>)
- Sodium nitrate (Similar to KNO<sub>3</sub>)
- Barium nitrate (colored matches)

### Binders

- Gum Arabic
- Dextrin
- Animal glue
- Synthetic polymers in modern heads

## Types Of Matches

 - **Safety matches** - Only ignite on a special surface ^2586b8
 - **Strike-anywhere matches** - Ignites on any rough surface because the head contains reactive phosphorus
 - **Waterproof matches** - Coated to resist water, use stronger chemicals to keep burning even in soaked places
 - **Lifeboat matches** - Designed to burn underwater, coated with magnesium to keep the flame going
 - **Candles** - Longer sticks
