Instead of politicians speaking from the land, this was astronauts talking from space. There where 5 historical broadcasts in July 1969:

 - Launch (16th) — Live on TV and radio, Walter Cronkite was ecstatic
 - On the way — They did live TV transmissions again, showing off 0 gravity, the Apollo 11, etc
 - Landing (20th) — Armstrong and Aldrin were being watched by almost 600m people on their descent. The US president called them while they were on the moon, live.
 - Return Trip — Also televised.

The entire public was into this like it was KPop Demon Hunters.
