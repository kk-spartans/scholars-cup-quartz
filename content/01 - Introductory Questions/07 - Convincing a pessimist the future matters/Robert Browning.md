Robert Browning (1812–1889) was an English poet and playwright known for his dramatic monologues and psychological insight. Born in Camberwell, London, he grew up in a well-off household with access to an impressive personal library, which helped him become a self-educated literary brainiac. Despite early flops like *Pauline* and *Sordello* (which confused everyone, including other poets), Browning kept pushing his own dense, challenging style. He eventually hit his stride with *Men and Women* and later *The Ring and the Book*, a sprawling 12-book poetic crime saga that showed off his love for moral complexity and character study.

His personal life was basically a Victorian romance novel. He fell in love with fellow poet Elizabeth Barrett, who was frail, brilliant, and bossed around by her father. They eloped to Italy, where she thrived, they had a kid, and wrote poetry side by side like the literary power couple they were. After her death, Browning returned to England, more famous than ever, and spent the rest of his life writing, networking, and basking in his legacy. By the time he died, he was considered one of the greats—though half of his readers probably still didn’t know what the hell he was talking about.
