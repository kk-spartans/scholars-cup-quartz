"Great powers" are the big players in global politics — countries with enough military, economic, and diplomatic influence to shape world events on their own. Think: U.S., China, Russia historically, maybe India or Germany in some contexts. They set the rules or at least bend them.

"Small powers" are sovereign states that don’t have the same global clout. They might be rich (like Singapore or Qatar) or militarily capable in their region, but they can’t independently sway major global decisions. They usually operate by aligning with bigger powers or forming coalitions.
