Jet engines, if you strip the flying part.

 - Sucks in air
 - Compresses and heats it with spinning compressor blades
 - Injects fuel, burns it, gets ginormous expansion of hot gas
 - The compressed gas spins the turbine, which spins the compressor and then turns a propeller or generator
 - Hot air leaves, sometimes adds thrust in jets
