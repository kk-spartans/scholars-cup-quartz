The eldest Pandava in the *Mahābhārata*, famous for being obsessively truthful and morally upright (to a fault). He loses his kingdom in a rigged dice game and spends years in exile before the epic war that reclaims the throne. Post-war, he becomes king but faces grim questions about justice, duty, and the cost of victory. He’s basically the moral compass who learns that being right doesn’t make consequences easy.
