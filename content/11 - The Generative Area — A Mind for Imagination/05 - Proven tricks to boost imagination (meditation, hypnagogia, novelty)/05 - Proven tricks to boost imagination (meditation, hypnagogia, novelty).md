I feel like hypnagogia would be the most effective here. Since you’re still technically awake, there’s a better change that you will remember the things you saw more vividly.

In a full on dream, you feel like it’s real in the dream — but your recollection of that when you’re awake is more cartoonish, dull (maybe grayscale), and just low quality.
