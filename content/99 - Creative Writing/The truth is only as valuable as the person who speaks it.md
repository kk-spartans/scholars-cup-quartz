According to society, truth is sacred. According to reality, truth is a popularity contest.

You could be spitting facts harder than anyone in the room — but how famous are you? The truth doesn’t travel on it’s own, it needs a carrier - and that carrier better have followers, reddit karma, a blue tick on x, and a green github contribution chart.

Imagine a random guy on reddit posts ‘the government is worse than the monopolies it hates’ - you scroll past. Snowden says the same thing? Now it’s a Netflix Documentary.

Truth isn’t measured by *what* is said. It’s measured by *who* says it. And honestly, most people don’t want truth — they want a vibe that sounds like truth, from someone they like. If Gandhi told you to touch grass, you’d reflect. If your little brother did, you’d tell him to shut up.

Even algorithms get it. Social media doesn’t just analyze the content — it checks the speaker. Good lighting, high engagement, symmetrical face? Viral. You could solve world hunger in a blurry video with 5 likes and still get buried under someone lip-syncing bad advice.

We treat truth like a divine object, but it’s actually a social one. Like money, it only works if people agree it has value. And value comes from trust. And trust? That’s just well-marketed consistency.

There’s a reason misinformation spreads faster than facts. A lie with clout will always beat a truth with none. The Earth isn’t flat — but the videos claiming it are entertaining, confident, and have banger background music. Most truths don’t stand a chance.

So no, truth isn’t enough. Not anymore. It needs a face, a voice, a following. In this world, the truth is only as valuable as the person who speaks it. Unfair? Yes.
