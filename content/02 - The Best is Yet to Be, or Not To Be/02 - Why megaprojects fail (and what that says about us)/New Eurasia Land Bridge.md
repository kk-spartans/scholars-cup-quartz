## What Happened Before

Shipping from China to Europe was slow and dependent on terrible water based routes. Wasting jet fuel was faster but expensive. Reviving Silk Road with trains sounded like a great idea — fast, cheaper than air, and less vulnerable than sea.

## What Happened During

China spent years building and upgrading train tracks across Central Asia and Europe. Trains were coordinated across dozens of border crossings, languages, and countries. It took a lot of negotiation, money, and track upgrades.

## What Happened After

Trains now run from places like Chongqing to Duisburg in less than two weeks. It’s much faster than ships and insanly cheaper than planes. But now the EU is whining about dependency on China for their goods. Geopolitics meets actual good deeds — predictable problems.
