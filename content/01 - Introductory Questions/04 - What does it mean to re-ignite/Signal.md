Signal is an amazing, self-hostable (kind of), open source, private messaging platform that emphasized privacy more than anything. It started in 2010 as the successor to TextSecure and RedPhone by Open Whisper Systems.

It continues to be a really good all rounder messaging app that a lot of people use and some self host servers for.
