A substance you can burn (or just react) to release energy. Anything from coal to glucose.

What all fuels have in common is that they have chemical bonds that release more energy than it costs to start the reaction when broken down during a reaction.

What makes these is:

 - Energy rich bonds like:
   - Hydrocarbons (C-H and C-C bonds) like gasoline and methane
   - Hydrogen (H-H bond)

 - Oxidizability â€” the atoms in the fuel react good with an oxidizer

What makes a *good* fuel is:

 - Not [[06 - Things Really Do Catch Fire/01 - What is fire and how does it work/Ignition#^f2cbb9\|Spontaneously combusting]]
 - Being dense like gasoline, not a gas like hydrogen
