> Nostradamus never predicted that people would remember him 500 years later, but his reputation for accurate prophecies has nonetheless flourished for centuries. Discuss with your team: why do people want to know their future in advance? Would it benefit them if they did? If someone offered you the opportunity to read a biography of your life, would you?

## Why Do People Want To Know The Future?

Because they want to prevent bad things that could happen in the future, or they just want to know the inevitable (it makes them feel safe or something).

If I were to tell you that you would d\*e in a month, you wouldn’t just live your regular life and go to school / work like normal — you would try and live life to the fullest and go on vacations or something.

Also, we want to know the future so we can prepare for it. That’s *almost* the reason why weather forecasts exist — so we can prepare for rain with umbrellas (or other weather).

## Would It Benefit Them It They Did?

Maybe, maybe not. But it definitely gives peace of mind, even if it’s bad — What’s the benefit of peace of mind? Calmness, serenity (?), stress-free-ness, other things.

Most of the time, it benefits them too — Imagine if we knew every single asteroid that would hit earth. We could prevent mass extinctions years before they even happen.

Depends on how the person got the information — if it’s just a *very, very* accurate estimate that has an insanely large chance of being true; yes.

But if they somehow time travelled into the future, I would first ask them “Will there be a time paradox if I read this? And can I change what’ll happen here?”, if yes to the first one and no to the second — then I don’t want to read it.

If there won’t be a time paradox if I read it, and I can change what’ll happen I would **definitely** read it — it’s a 100% true timeline of my entire life. Imagine what I could do with that information.

I could probably see every single embarrassing mistake I ever will make and *not* make it. I could see why colleges reject me and **try again**.
