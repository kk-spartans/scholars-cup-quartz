I really don’t like that Will Smith (US President) makes America get all the credit for saving the planet.

But the appreciation that the president gives to the soldiers and pilots and the “mankind, huh?” is very effective in gaining their trust.

Would this be effective in real life? If an actual alien somehow invaded earth, yes — it would. But it would never happen — every single president, of every single country in this world, would never even touch the level of informality over here.
