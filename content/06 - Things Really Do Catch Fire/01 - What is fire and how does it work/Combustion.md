Often used interchangeably with burning.

 - **Burning** - Any everyday term, used to describe *visible, glowing* combustion. If there’s a flame or glow, it’s burning.

 - **Combustion** - A chemical reaction where a substance reacts with an oxidizer (usually oxygen) and releases energy (heat, light, sometimes sound). It doesn’t have to involve flames — like smoldering charcoal or a car engine.
