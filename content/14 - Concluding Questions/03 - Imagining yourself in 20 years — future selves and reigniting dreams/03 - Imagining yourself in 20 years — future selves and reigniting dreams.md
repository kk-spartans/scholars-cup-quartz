> Work with your team to imagine yourselves reuniting in 20 years; you can even use AI tools online to create images of what you’ll like in the future. What kind of world will you be living in, and what sorts of people will you become? Which of your dreams, if any, do you think will need reigniting?

<!-- My team doesn’t have the time for this, so let me describe me, and I’m not touching diffusion models every again -->

## The World

idk probably the same. What was the world like 20 years ago? We still had most of the things the same, we talked in english, we still used TCP/IP, we still were the smartest species we know of.

So the world will probably be the same, other than incremental improvements in already existing tech — maybe there’s 10x more code being written because of AI, and maybe that code is actually good.

Maybe *most* of the world is now using electric cars, instead of *more than some*.

## Me

I would be in my 30s by then. I would probably have written atleast one usable, useful open source project out of my gigantic list of projects I should make.

I would probably have atleast one good stream of income, maybe even multiple, finished college, and become and adult (eww).

## Reignitable Dreams

Probably wanting to major in science instead of be a computer science nerd. I don’t have many other dreams.
