I **will** defend myself.

Some places don’t need nvme ssds as fast as vram from the 2010s, they just need cheap storage. And magnetic tape is cheaper than dirt while being a bit faster than HDDs (but need more gear, which doesn’t matter at mass).

|                   | Magnetic Tape     | HDDs | NVMe SSDs |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ---- | --------- |
| Price/TB          | $11~ (with drive) | $13~ | $60~      |
| Read/Write (MB/s) | 300               | 160  | 15,000    |

See the difference?
