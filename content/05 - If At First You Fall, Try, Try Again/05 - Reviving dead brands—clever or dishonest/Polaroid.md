Founded in 1937 by Edwin H. Land — revolutionized photography with it’s *almost* instant (1/60). They filed for Chapter 11 in 2001 because of competition from the digital camera market.

Acquired by one equity partners and rebranded to Primary PDC Inc. in 2008 (it gave up on instant camera about now). One year before the og iphone came out.

In the same year, the impossible project was founded and worked with whatever company that polaroid was owned by at that time to figure out to manufacture cameras and film modules.

In 2017, the *practical* owner of the impossible project got all of Polaroids assets. Now, polaroid makes film for polaroid cameras and is a lifestyle brand.
