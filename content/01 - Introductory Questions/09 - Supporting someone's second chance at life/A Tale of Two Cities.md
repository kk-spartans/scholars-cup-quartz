(summary by gpt4o #ai, I modified it a bit)

***A Tale of Two Cities*** by Charles Dickens is a historical novel set during the French Revolution, bouncing between London and Paris (hence the “two cities”). Here's the gist:

A man named **Charles Darnay**, a French aristocrat who rejects his cruel family's legacy, and **Sydney Carton**, a disillusioned English lawyer, both fall in love with **Lucie Manette**, the daughter of **Dr. Alexandre Manette**, who was unjustly imprisoned in the Bastille for 18 years.

As the French Revolution explodes, Darnay gets caught up in the chaos and is arrested. In the end, Carton—despite living a pretty wasted life—chooses to sacrifice himself to save Darnay for Lucie’s sake. He literally dies in Darnay’s place, going to the guillotine with the iconic line:  

**“It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done…”**

Themes? Justice vs. revenge, resurrection, sacrifice, the madness of mobs, and how love can redeem even the most broken among us.
