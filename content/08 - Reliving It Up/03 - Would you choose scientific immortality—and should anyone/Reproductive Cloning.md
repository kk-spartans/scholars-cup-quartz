Making a new organism that’s genetically identical to another. Like [Dolly](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dolly_(sheep)&oldid=1306531051). You take a cell from an organism, put it’s DNA into an egg with a removed nucleus. Now you stimulate it to grow, and you have a living creature.

People say this is unethical for humans, I say emotions are useless.
