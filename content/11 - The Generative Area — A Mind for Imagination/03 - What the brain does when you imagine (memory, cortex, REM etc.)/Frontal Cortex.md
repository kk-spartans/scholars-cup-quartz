The frontal cortex manages executive functions such as planning, decision-making, inhibition, and working memory. It enables conscious manipulation of imagined scenarios.

Disruption to the frontal cortex impairs imaginative control. People may generate wild, disorganized, or impulsive scenarios without logical structure, reducing coherence but sometimes enhancing raw creative output in unconventional ways.
