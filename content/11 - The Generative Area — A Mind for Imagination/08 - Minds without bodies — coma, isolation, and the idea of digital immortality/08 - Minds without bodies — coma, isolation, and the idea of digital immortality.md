> The 2016 short film *[Shelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0)* portrays a girl living alone in a simulation, passing her days imagining virtual worlds—until one day a letter arrives explaining how she got there. This film is one of many that explores how the human mind can remain active in a world without physical stimuli—which could be your fate if humans achieve digital immortality in our lifetimes.

Coma patients have surprisingly active brains, they can even respond to non yes or no questions if you ask it right. But they’re often trapped with no way to communicate. And over time, without external simulation, the brain kind of `docker system prune -af`’s itself over months / years.

And the brain *hates* sensory deprivation, even with solitary confinement. People in isolation often hallucinate because their brain starts making its own input.

Long-term isolation can mess up sleep cycles, memory, and even sense of self; humans rely on social feedback to stay mentally stable.

I would never be happy without a body — that body can be physical (atleast what we define it as today), or virtual (but with everything I want and things to accomplish and die with), or simulated (with the same requirements of virtual).

But everyone wants a body, you can’t live without a body.
