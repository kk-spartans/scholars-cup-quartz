The Computus is basically **Christian math wizardry** used to figure out the date of **Easter**. Since Easter is supposed to fall on the Sunday after the first full moon after the **vernal equinox**, it’s a mix of solar and lunar timing. The church standardized this using tables and cycles, most notably the **19-year Metonic cycle**, to approximate full moons and the equinox date. It’s not perfect, but good enough for liturgical use.

Easter is the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after March 21 (vernal equinox, roughly). That means you need to track both the solar year and a pseudo-lunar calendar (using something like the 19-year Metonic cycle) to predict Easter. The actual algorithms get *wild*, with golden numbers, epacts, and tables that look like the scribblings of a monk with caffeine withdrawal.

- **1 year = 365.2425 days (solar)**
- **1 computus cycle = 19 years (lunar-solar sync)**
- **Lunar months used: ≈29.5 days**
