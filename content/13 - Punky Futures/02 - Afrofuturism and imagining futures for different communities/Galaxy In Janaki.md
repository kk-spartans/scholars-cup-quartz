FlyLo uses glitchy electronics, jazz lineage, and ritual-like composition to make interior cosmologies — grief, ancestry, and tech fused into sonic ritual. Tracks like “Galaxy in Janaki” aren’t political pamphlets; they’re sonic speculative spaces that fold memory and futurity together — a milder, introspective strain of Afrofuturist sound.
