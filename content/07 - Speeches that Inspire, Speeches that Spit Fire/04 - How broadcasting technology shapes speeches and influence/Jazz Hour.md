Hosted by Willis Conover, legend behind the Iron Curtain. Ran from ~1955-1995, he spoke deliberately slow, clear english (just so listeners could understand him and learn english if they didn’t know).

Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie — all the big names. For people in Eastern Europe and the USSR, where jazz was censored or restricted, this was a lifeline to an alternative culture.
