## What Happened Before

Sri Lanka wanted to decantralize the central government from Colombo and turn Hambantota into a bustling city for trade. Why there? Because the president at the time (Mahinda Rajapaksa) was from there and China was ecstatic to fund it, offering buckets of money to Sri Lanka.

## What Happened During

They built a port, and an airport â€” but both of them were mostly empty and definitely not as used as they thought it would be. They couldn't pay back their debt to China, so a Chinese company agreed to take a 70% stake and a 99 year lease of the land from Sri Lanka.

## What Happened After

Right now, the port is mostly used to transport vehicles and the airport is mostly quiet with 2 international terminals and 1 domestic one<!-- What sane human being is taking flights through the same insanely tiny archipelago? -->. Sri Lanka also became more economically dependent on China than any other country.
