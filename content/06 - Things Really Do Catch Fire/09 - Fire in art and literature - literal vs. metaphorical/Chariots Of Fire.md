There aren’t any lyrics for me to rate here, but still — the song feels optimistic. But in the play that this song was supposed to be used in, “fire” is metaphorical, not literal.

Fire means courage, passion, and faith. Especially for Eric Liddell, who refuses to run on Sundays even if it costs him gold.
