MySpace started in 2003 as a social media juggernaut, giving people their first taste of customizing profiles, friending Tom, and discovering music through embedded playlists. It quickly became the biggest site in the U.S., peaking in the mid-2000s with millions of users and a vibe that was part teenage rebellion, part HTML chaos. For a while, it looked like nothing could dethrone it.

Then Facebook rolled up with a cleaner interface, fewer sparkly GIFs, and actual utility, and MySpace's cool factor died faster than a pop-punk band's second album. It tried to pivot to music and entertainment, but by then the audience had moved on. Today, itâ€™s basically a digital graveyard haunted by band pages and broken Flash widgets.
