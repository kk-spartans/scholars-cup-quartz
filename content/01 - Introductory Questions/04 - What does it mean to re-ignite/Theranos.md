A company that was founded by Elizabeth Anne Holmes in 2003. It claimed that it had made blood tests that could conduct an insanely large amount of tests with an insanely small amount of blood.

Later, by 2018, these claims were proven to be false and Holmes and the company's president (Sunny Balwani) were charged with fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy. They went to jail soon after in 2022 November.
