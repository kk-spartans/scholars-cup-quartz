According to tech support, **it’s always user error.** According to common sense, sometimes the system was just built stupid.

“Blame the machine, not the mechanic” sounds like an excuse. But think about it — if the car has no brakes, does it matter who’s driving?

We love blaming the person holding the tool. But maybe the tool was *designed* to fail, to exploit, or to cause chaos. Like social media — you think the intern writing tweets caused societal collapse? Nah. It’s the machine. The algorithm. The feedback loop from hell.

The mechanic (a.k.a. the person) is just pushing buttons they didn’t design, in a system they don’t fully control. You can’t blame the pilot if the autopilot flies into a mountain.

Look at AI. Or recommendation engines. Or credit scoring systems. They’re not neutral. They come with baked-in rules. They *decide* what matters — and if that decision is garbage, the outcome’s gonna stink no matter who presses “run.”

Even in schools, jobs, politics — people operate inside rigid, clunky systems. You can swap out the humans a thousand times and still get the same dysfunction, because the machine’s running the show.

And sure, sometimes the mechanic *is* bad. But you wouldn’t blame the cashier for inflation. Or the bus driver for traffic. Or the barista for your emotional damage. So why blame the person when the system’s the one rigged?

Blame the machine when it rewards the wrong behavior. Blame the machine when it punishes logic. Blame the machine when ten different people fail in the *exact* same way. Blame the machine when it’s running windows, an OS made for normal people still breaks when linux (a nerd OS with custom Desktop envs) runs completely fine, faster.

Systems create outcomes. People just carry them out. So stop yelling at the mechanic for leaking oil — maybe the engine was built to break.

Blame the machine. Not just because it’s fair — but because it's the only way anything actually changes.
