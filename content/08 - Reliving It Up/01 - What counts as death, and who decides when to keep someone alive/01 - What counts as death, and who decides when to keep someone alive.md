> “Time of death,” says a doctor on TV, after frantic efforts to get someone’s heart pumping again fail, “5:11 am.” If it were only that simple! Research is increasingly suggesting that [death is a complex process](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/17/1082937/what-is-death/), sometimes reversible—sometimes not. Explore the differences between resuscitation and resurrection, then, without getting too dark, discuss with your team: how much of a person’s mind needs to be intact for it to be a good idea to keep them alive—and who should decide? You may also want to explore some historical ideas about what happens after death.

Resuscitation is dragging someone away from the edge of a cliff. Their heart stopped, they’re not breathing, but their brain hasn’t ascended yet. CPR, defibs, adrenaline — basically yelling at the body until it decides to reboot. Works because death is a process, not a switch.

Resurrection is dragging someone up a cliff after they’ve fell down, hit the bottom, and decomposed a bit. This is religion — not medicine.

## Bringing People Back To Life

In my opinion — the things that matter are

 - Who it is — if there’s no one in this world that wants a person back, not even themselves, should the really be brough back?
 - Brain intactness — If the cortex and key networks are gone, what’s there in their brain that makes them, them? You might have a beating heart, but zero *you* left.
 - Who decides — law, doctors, relatives

If that person has nothing that differentiates them from a generic “human”, there’s no point in it.
