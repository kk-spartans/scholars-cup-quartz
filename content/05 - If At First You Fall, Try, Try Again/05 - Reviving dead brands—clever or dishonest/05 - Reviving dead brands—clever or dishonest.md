> Sometime in 2025, a dead airline will return to the skies. A private company is planning to de-extinct the once-legendary airline brand Pan Am for some [very expensive charter flights](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/pan-am-revival-tour-flights-2025), with hints of bringing it back in a bigger fashion down the line. And, speaking of fashion, Pan Am has already been revived as [a South Korean clothing brand](https://insideretail.asia/2022/08/31/onetime-airline-pan-am-reimagined-in-south-korea-as-a-lifestyle-brand/). Consider the examples below of other brand names that have been brought back from the dead to sell new products and services–even if they are unconnected to the companies that spawned them. Discuss with your team: is this kind of branding dishonest, and what derelict brands or companies would you want to reintroduce–and in what forms?

A lot of stuff was very useful for this, like:

 - crunchbase.com
 - sec.gov
 - uspto.gov
 - tmsearch.uspto.gov
 - you get the idea

But I’m not sure I should be reading business reports here, so this might be a waste of time.

It isn’t dishonest or honest in any way — it’s just new companies using old brands as nostalgia marketing.

I would love if the [Boosted Board](https://boostedusa.com/) came back.
