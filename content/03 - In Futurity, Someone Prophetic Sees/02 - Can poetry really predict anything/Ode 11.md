```
Leucon, no one’s allowed to know his fate,  
```

`Leucon` is the person who this is being sent to, `Leuconoe` was in the actual poem, but this is a modern translation.

And `his` isn’t referring to anyone in particular, basically means “their” or “anyone’s”

```
Not you, not me: don’t ask, don’t hunt for answers  

In tea leaves or palms. Be patient with whatever comes.  
```

This is a reference to old ways of fortune telling.

 - Tea leaves is “tasseography”, an old form of fortune telling by reading patterns in tea residue.
 - Palms is just “palmistry”, reading someone’s fate by the lines on their hands.

This could be our last winter, it could be many  

More, pounding the Tuscan Sea on these rocks:  
```

The Tuscan sea is the Tyrrhenian Sea, west of Italy. Just a poetic way to name it, since it borders Tuscanny.

```

Do what you must, be wise, cut your vines  

And forget about hope. Time goes running, even  

As we talk. Take the present, the future’s no one’s affair.
```

Cut your vines basically just means “stop dreaming, start doing”.
