Multipolarity is **obviously** better. Right now, we are *kind of* a unipolar world — around the US. The **ENTIRE** economy crashed, just because of one country, with around 4% of the world’s population, increasing tariffs.

If one of the countries mess up in a unipolar (or bipolar) world, the entire world is temporarily cooked. If we have a multipolar world *where USD wasn’t the only currency*, we wouldn’t get global recessions because of 150% import tariffs by one country.

But noooooo... to get leadership, you need war and status — not a working brain.
