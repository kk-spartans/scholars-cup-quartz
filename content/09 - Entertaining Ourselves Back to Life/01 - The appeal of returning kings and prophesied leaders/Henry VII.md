Founder of the Tudor dynasty after winning the 1485 Battle of Bosworth Field and ending the Wars of the Roses. He married Elizabeth of York to unite rival houses, tightened royal finances, and built the administrative foundations that made later Tudors powerful. Skilled at playing nobles off each other and avoiding open conflict. Quiet, ruthless, and efficient â€” the bureaucrat who started a dynasty.
