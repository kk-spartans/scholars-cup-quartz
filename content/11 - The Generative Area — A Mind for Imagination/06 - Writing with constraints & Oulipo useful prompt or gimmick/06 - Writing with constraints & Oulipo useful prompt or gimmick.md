> One used by writers is called “writing with constraints”. If their options are limited—for instance, if they cannot use the letter A in a story—someone struggling to put words on a blank page might dodge that first paralyzing moment of decision-making. Artificial limitations “provide a certain level of texture against which a metaphorical match can more easily be struck,” says the writer [Matthew Tomkinson](https://lithub.com/five-writers-on-how-writing-with-creative-constraints-unlocked-their-projects/). Many traditional poetic forms—especially strict ones, such as haiku—are examples of this approach. Read about others across different genres, including those of the French Oulipo movement, then learn more about the selections below. Afterward, discuss with your team: should more creators use this technique? When they do, should it be advertised to the public? Would you want to try it for your World Scholar’s Cup writing event?

<!-- I had to use a zero-width joiner between 1930 and s to make sure it wouldn’t turn it into 1930 seconds and display 32m 10s -->

In my opinion, creators should use this technique — but not arbitrary limitations like not using the letter `A`. Something like “the ending should be complete”, something that appeals to the reader and not just something that you can say.

Either way, if you do use this — you should probably advertise it to the public. Or even better, write something that’s considered good even without these limitations, and then announce the use of the limitations later — people will go insane over that.
