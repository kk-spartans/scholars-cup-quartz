> People have searched for ways to live forever—well, [basically forever](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/05/01/immortality-gilgamesh-bezos-thiel/). Today, many fields of scientific research, many [spurred on by billionaires](https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/08/human-immortality-in-33-years-claims-dmitry-itskovs-2045-initiative), promise that we are [on the cusp](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/techs-next-big-disruption-could-be-delaying-death.html) of finding the answer—or at least a way to extend our lives in unprecedented ways. Explore the following technologies and discuss with your team: would you choose to undergo these treatments if they were available to you? Would it be good for society if people lived for centuries?

We need to [[02 - The Best is Yet to Be, or Not To Be/05 - Birth rates, bad times, and the future of humanity/05 - Birth rates, bad times, and the future of humanity#^a6a4ad\|reduce the population]] — not increase it. It would (right now) not be good for society if people lived for centuries, because we don’t have enough materials — those people would be tortured in their living life anyway. (also we don’t have the money to do this to every single person in the world anyway)

And cryonics can’t fix stupidity — if you completely destroy your brain by jumping off a cliff, you’re unrecoverable.

In this world, I wouldn’t take any of this — in a world where land is plenty and the economy is large, I would.

The thing is, we’ve already been expanding our lives a lot since hunter-gatherer humans — their average lifespans was 25-35 years (skewed by child mortality, but still). Right now, it’s about 70, all because of medicine.
