> One way or another, people did start the fire. While fires can occur naturally, different methods—such as matches, and episodes of the Apprentice—now allow us to start them at will. Investigate historical fire-starting, from stones and flint to ants and [lenses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZNsfx7soUs). Discuss with your team: should children be taught how to start fires—and, if so, at what age?

Should children be taught how to start fires? Depends on what.

No one uses lenses, hand drills, etc. to start fires — so no one, especially children, should know how to use these.

Matches and lighters? You don’t need to *learn* how to use these, it’s extremely easy. You need to *overcome* the fear of them — at least that’s what I needed to do.

What age? At the age where they can comprehend the world enough to know how to *intentionally* press a button on a lighter and not shove their face in the flame. Usually 7-9 (maybe younger).
