> How often do you pick up your phone to check a fact or answer a question during a meal with friends or family? Can you imagine living in a world where things just—stay mysterious, and where you have no idea what is happening a thousand miles away? Researchers have found that the oversaturation of news, especially of negative stories, [leads to constant stress](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/11/strain-media-overload) and a [skewed worldview](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200512-how-the-news-changes-the-way-we-think-and-behave), especially when they contain [violent images and videos](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psychology-through-technology/202402/traumatic-media-overload-could-impact-our-mental-health). Discuss with your team: to protect people’s mental health, should the government (or others) limit the amount of information we can consume?

I feel like the government does **not** have the right to control information that we consume, that doesn’t mean someone shouldn’t.

As covered in the previous topic, social media companies will do nothing about this. So only we can.

## My Experience

I personally feel like I get stressed out when my questions aren’t answered. Like in school, I have a random though along the lines of “Is gpt-oss actually better than qwen3?” and “Why do people like the t3 stack so bad?”  

And when I get home, I look it up, and I feel *less* like I don’t know something. Even if the reason is because the creator of it died or something (which it isn’t)

I feel like this isn’t the point of the question though, this is people ingesting new information without actually having questions about it.

## Other People

If this is actually affecting people’s mental health (which I doubt), we should probably control the way that it changes our moods, and not control how much of it we take in (unless we want to).

For example, if we see bad news - we should be thinking “Why are only a few of these stories on the news?” and not “Awwww… that’s sad”.

I feel like social media isn’t the problem here — people are.
