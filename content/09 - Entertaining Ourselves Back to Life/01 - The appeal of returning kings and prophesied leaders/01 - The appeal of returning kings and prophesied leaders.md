> The third book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is titled The Return of the King; in it (spoilers ahead) the character Aragorn returns to unite humanity against a dire threat. The idea of a prophesied king reappearing and bringing his people together again against a formidable foe is common in literary history, from the overtold legend of King Arthur to the incomplete story of Jon Snow.

People eat “return of the rightful ruler” tales because they solve anxiety fast: they promise restoration of order, moral clarity, and a simple fix after chaos. Those stories package legitimacy (divine blood, victory, law, or charisma) into a single figure who *can* fix things — emotionally cheap and politically useful. They’re also comfort-food myth: someone comes back and everything’s made whole.

(That pattern — trauma → longing → charismatic return — maps neatly onto political nostalgia and populism: leaders promising to “bring back” a better past or restore national greatness.)

## Modern Parallels (real-world causes)

- Post-crisis legitimacy gaps: when institutions look weak after economic shocks, war, or corruption, voters get receptive to “return” narratives.
- Nostalgia politics: slogans that promise a restored past (“Make X Great Again”) mobilize identity and grievance.
- Engineered restorations: sometimes elites literally reinstall old orders (think post-authoritarian monarchies or negotiated returns) — modern Juan Carlos–style transitions can be heroic *and* fragile.
