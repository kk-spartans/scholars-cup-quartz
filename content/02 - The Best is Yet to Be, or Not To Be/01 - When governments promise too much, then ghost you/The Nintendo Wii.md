## What Happened Before

In the early 2000s, Nintendo was getting **absolutely clobbered** in the console wars (even though pcs existed). The GameCube sold, but not enough — It couldn't match the raw horsepower of the graphics card on the PS2 or the OG Xbox. Instead of worrying about that, the *quietly* started working on a console that had motion detective controllers. No ginormous GPU, no HDR graphics (joke), and no online ecosystem. Just a funky-looking controller and a vision that gaming should be fun for everyone — not just sweaty teens and graphic snobs.

## What Happened During

In 2006, they launched the Nintendo Wii. The name got roasted. The hardware was mocked. Critics and gamers alike expected a niche console at best — maybe good for party games and younger audiences. But once people got their hands on it? Different story. **Wii Sports** turned living rooms into virtual tennis courts. Families were playing together. Nursing homes were holding bowling tournaments. Nintendo had barely promised anything revolutionary… and yet they quietly changed the gaming industry.

## What Happened After

The Wii outsold the Xbox 360 and PS3 by tens of millions. It reached players who had never touched a console before. Developers scrambled to make motion-controlled games. Even Sony and Microsoft awkwardly followed suit with the Move and Kinect. Meanwhile, Nintendo just kept printing. By underpromising and then wildly overdelivering, they created a global phenomenon — all without bragging about specs or power.
