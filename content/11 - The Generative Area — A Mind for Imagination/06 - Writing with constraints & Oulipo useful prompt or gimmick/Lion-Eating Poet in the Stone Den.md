A poem that, when read out, only uses the sound “shi” in different tones (written in chinese).

Something about a poet named Shi Shi who was addicted to lions; he went to the market to look for lions, at 10, 10 lions arrived. Soon after, 10 lions died, he brought the corpses home and wanted to eat them, then he realized they were stone corpses.
