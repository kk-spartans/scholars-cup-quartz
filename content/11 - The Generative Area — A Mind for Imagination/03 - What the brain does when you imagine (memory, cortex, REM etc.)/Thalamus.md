The thalamus acts as a sensory relay station, filtering inputs from the body to the cortex. It organizes attention and integrates multisensory information, forming coherent internal representations.

Thalamic dysfunction distorts imagination by misrouting or overloading sensory signals. Mental imagery may be fragmented, inconsistent, or hypersensory, creating dreamlike or confusing fantasy experiences that are hard to control.
