> Sometimes cars don’t start—but when they do, how does it happen? Explore the ways in which cars can be powered on. And that’s only the start(er): once a car is moving, it speeds away propelled by a series of mini-explosions that keep moving it along until the next traffic jam. With your team, explore the science behind internal combustion engines. How do they work, when were they invented, and are they obsolete? Be sure to consider the following topics:

Most cars start with a starter motor (powered by the battery) that spins the crankshaft fast enough to kick off the first combustion. At the same time, the spark plugs ignite the fuel/air mix in the cylinders.

First practical gas-powered engine appeared in 1860 Nikolaus Otto invented the four-stroke engine in 1876, which is basically what most cars still use.

In 1885, Karl Benz put a gasoline engine in a vehicle — basically the first modern car. The 1908 ford model T made it mainstream.

ICEs are not obsolete just because they’re old. 

 - Pros — Mature tech, cheap-ish, refueling is fast.

 - Cons — Pollutes, less efficient than electric motors, requires oil changes, and global regulations are cracking down.

 - EVs and Plug In Hybrids — Slowly replacing them, especially in urban areas and Europe/China/US mandates.
