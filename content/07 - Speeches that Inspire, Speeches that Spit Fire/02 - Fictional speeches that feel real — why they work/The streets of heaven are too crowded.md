The addressing of the people who died, like saying 2 swimmers, is better than what most politicians do. And the repeating-the-same-thing-but-making-it-more-emphasized works very well over here.

Would this work in real life? I don’t think so; people aren’t willing enough to remove their souls from existence anymore. So I don’t think any speech could work in this scenario.
