Movie starts with some fighting between a brother and a sister, Katara and Sokka. Their mom died and only their grandma is left - and they live in a world where:

> There are 4 benders, each one of the elements that people can be; Air, Water, Fire, and Earth - each one can do special things with their element (like spawn walls, or create fire with their hands). The 4 benders used to be in harmony, but now are in war.

The girl and the boy are both Waterbenders.

In every single generation, the avatar gets reincarnated. But for the last century, there seemed to be no avatar. Aang was the avatar 100 years ago and he got frozen in an iceberg, the girl and her brother find him.

After finding him, they find out he was only taught airbending. They have to teach him the other 4 elements quick - so they find teachers of them and teach him the elements.

Now they do some weird kidnapping and re-kidnapping Aang before beating the fire nation.

The main part here is how sad Aang was to see his entire family and everyone he knew dead when he woke up.
