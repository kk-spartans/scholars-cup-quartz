> A hundred years is a long time. What if the same thing happened, but you woke up (like Rip Van Winkle!) only 20 years in the future? What do you imagine the year 2045 will be like for students like you? What are the easiest things to predictâ€“and what are the hardest?

Again, it would be better to look at [[01 - Introductory Questions/03 - Predicting 2045 for students today/The Routine In 2005]], [[01 - Introductory Questions/01 - Noticing future through daily details/The Routine Right Now]] and [[01 - Introductory Questions/03 - Predicting 2045 for students today/The Differences Between 2005 and Now]] to predict 2045.

It wouldn't be that different from now, and it would mostly contain incremental improvements to already existing technology. For example, we might have better battery life on our phones - but nothing would have *transcended* phones. You can apply this logic to anything you want and it would probably stay true.
