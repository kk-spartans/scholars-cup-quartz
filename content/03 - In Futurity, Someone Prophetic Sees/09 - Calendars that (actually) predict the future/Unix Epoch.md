Number of seconds since January 1, 1970. Just that. Some systems use nanoseconds, microseconds, or milliseconds internally, but this is the standard — no leap seconds, just a pure timer.

A leap second is sometimes issued by UTC to account for slight changes in the Earth’s rotation, when this happens, clocks go:

> 23:59:59 → 23:59:60 → 00:00:00

Instead of:

> 23:59:59 → 00:00:00

This has no schedule, it’s very unpredictable.
