> JFK’s most famous speech may have been about going to the moon, but that giant leap was a lot easier to achieve than peace in his (or our) time. Watch these [selected excerpts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf4eQhrHbKA) from his “peace speech” at American University, then discuss with your team: is it possible to give a passionate speech about peace, and, if so, does JFK succeed here? Is he naïve about the role of the United States in world affairs? Then consider the speeches listed below and discuss with your team: are they, too, inspirational—or naïve? Can they be both?

## Is It Possible To Give A Passionate Speech About Peace?

Yes, it definitely is. If you stop being fascist, and start worrying about the entire world — it is. Just like what JFK did here, specifically deny wanting a Pax Americana (international peace, but overseen by the US/UK), and addressing the entire world.

Imo he is kinda naive about the role of the US, he underestimates it. But that doesn’t matter as much as acknowledging the presence of the outside world, which most US presidents (*cough* Trump *cough*) fail to do.

This speech is not “inspirational” to me.
