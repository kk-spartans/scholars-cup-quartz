“involves a practitioner (shaman) interacting with the spirit world through altered states of consciousness, such as trance.” - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shamanism&oldid=1300359952)

A trance is basically when someone’s unconscious but weirdly tuned in into their surroundings inside their thoughts — basically lucid dreaming on steroids. ^d1a179
