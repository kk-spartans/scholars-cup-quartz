I really can’t see *what’s* on fire in this smudged up painting, I can see something is on fire though, in this context it’s probably the houses of lords and commons (the fire that burned down the houses of parliament in London).

The artist doesn’t mean anything by this painting, he just drew what was in front of him — a fire. Very literal.
