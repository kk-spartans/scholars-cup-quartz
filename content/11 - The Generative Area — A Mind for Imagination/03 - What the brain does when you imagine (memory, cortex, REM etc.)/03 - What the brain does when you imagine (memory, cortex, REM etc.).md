> Consider the [neurobiology of imagination](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3662866/): what actually happens in your brain when you are imagining things? Explore the terms below, then hypothesize with your team: how might a person’s imagination be affected if you alter one or more of these elements? How do they relate to emotions, belief, suppositions, and fantasy?

Imaginations is definitely linked to emotions, belief, suppositions, and fantasy. Changing any of this can make a person’s emotions go insane. Perception and memory shape emotions, and REM mostly determines narrative (because of dreams).
