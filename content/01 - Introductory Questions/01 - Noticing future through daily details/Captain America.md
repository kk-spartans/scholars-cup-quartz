Captain America got frozen in ice during World War II and woke up about 70 years later in the modern world, physically unchanged thanks to the super-soldier serum â€” basically a patriotic popsicle with abs. When he thawed out, everything had changed; the tech, the culture, the slang, and even the food. But unlike most people who oversleep and miss a meeting, he missed entire wars, generations of history, and the death of everyone he knew.

He quickly realized he was a man out of time (literally) which made him kind of a tragic boomer with a shield. He joined up with S.H.I.E.L.D. and later the Avengers, trying to catch up while fighting increasingly weird threats. But emotionally, he was always playing catch up, stuck between the values of the past and the chaos of the present.
