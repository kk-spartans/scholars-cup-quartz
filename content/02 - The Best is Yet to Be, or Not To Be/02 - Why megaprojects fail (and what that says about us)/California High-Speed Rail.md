## What Happened Before

Californians dreamed of sleek, fast trains zipping through the state like it was Japan, but in reality, it was just endless traffic and overpriced short-haul flights. In 2008, voters approved a plan to build a high-speed rail connecting SF and LA. It was pitched as eco friendly, congestion busting, and futuristic.

Spoiler: it turned into a bureaucratic fever dream.

## What Happened During

They broke ground in 2015 and immediately got stuck in land acquisition hell. Lawsuits from farmers, towns, and NIMBYs slowed everything down. Budgets exploded from the original ~$33B to estimates pushing $100B. As of now, the only semi-functional part is a segment in the Central Valley — aka train-to-nowhere land. SF to LA? Still a powerpoint slide.

## What Happened After

It’s become the poster child for American infrastructure dysfunction. The vision is technically still alive, but most Californians treat it like vaporware. Maintenance for unused track is ongoing, and political support fluctuates every election cycle. Maybe your grandkids will ride it. Maybe not.
