In C. S. Lewis’s Narnia series, the Pevensie children are magically summoned back to help a young prince reclaim his throne from usurpers and restore Narnia’s talking creatures and magic. It’s a “return to a lost world” story that deals with courage, rightful rule, and the clash between old wonder and new power. Lewis layers in Christian allegory but keeps it as an adventurous, moral tale for kids and nostalgic adults.
