> Some poets have also taken a swing at predicting the future. Consider the selections below, then discuss with your team: how seriously were they intended to tell the future? Is poetry (with its often murky meanings) the perfect vehicle for prophecy?

They were very seriously intended to predict the future in my opinion (based on the words used) — it doesn’t seem like that was just to rhyme.

And I feel like poetry is a good way to express opinion, not prophecy. Prophecy is deterministic.
