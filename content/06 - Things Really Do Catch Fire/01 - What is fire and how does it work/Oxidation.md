When a substance loses electrons. Most of the time, it’s related with reacting with oxygen, like when iron rusts. But technically it’s all about the electron loss, not just oxygen.

Not always related to burning, for example:

> 4Fe + 3O<sub>2</sub>​ + 6H<sub>2</sub>​O → 4Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>​

Anything [[06 - Things Really Do Catch Fire/01 - What is fire and how does it work/01 - What is fire and how does it work#^8bf3e5\|here]] is also an example of oxidation.
