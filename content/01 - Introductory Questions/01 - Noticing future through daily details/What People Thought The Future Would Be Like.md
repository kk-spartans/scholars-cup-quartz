Letâ€™s look at what people thought would exist in a century and look at the mistakes they made so we don't repeat the same.

 - People thought we would have personal flying cars, good lesson to not be too optimistic

 - People thought we would have switches that could control the weather immediately, we can throw salt at the clouds and pray for the best.

 - People thought we would have telephones but for video, one thing that actually exists.

 - People thought we would have **humanoid** robot servants, a human has the worst shape to do chores. So, we made robot vacuums and window cleaners and dishwashers, etc.

 - We would've also had underwater cities, I'm speechless.

 - Also, they predicted that we would have machines playing instruments. This is a good reminder to not stick to only what we have now and think of new things (like speakers)
