## What Happened Before

The Pearl River Delta needed better connectivity between three main cities — Hong Kong, Macau, and Zhuhai. Ferries and drives were long, and China wanted to flex its infrastructure.

## What Happened During

Construction began in 2009. The final result was a 55km mix of bridges, tunnels, and literal artificial islands. It opened in 2018 after cost overruns, multiple deaths, and quality control problems. The Chinese government boasted about it as a feat of modern engineering.

## What Happened After

It works, but strict border controls and limited permits mean it’s underused. But it's still shiny, massive, and politically symbolic — even if most people still take the ferry.
