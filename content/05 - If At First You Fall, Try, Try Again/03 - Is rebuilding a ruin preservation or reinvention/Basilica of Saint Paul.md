Founded on a 4th-century shrine over Saint Paul’s burial site, the basilica grew, decayed, and was redeveloped across late antiquity and the Middle Ages; a catastrophic fire in 1823 destroyed much of the medieval fabric.

Pope Leo XII led an international campaign to rebuild the church “in the same way,” and 19th-century restorers reused what they could while layering a strong neo-classical/Baroque-era imprint into the rebuilt nave, capitals, and mosaics.
