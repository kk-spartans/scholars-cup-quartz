- **Trying to be:** Tang Dynasty’s glory—cultural brilliance, centralized bureaucracy, Confucian order.
- **How close?** Economically and culturally, they nailed it—gunpowder, printing, massive trade. Militarily, though… they lost North China to nomads and eventually all of China to the Mongols.
- **Longevity:** Tang lasted ~300 years; Song lasted 319 years (if you count both Northern & Southern Song), so yes, slightly longer.
