## What Happened Before

Back in the 2000s, Chennai thought a city‑wide monorail was the best way to beat traffic. In 2006, CMDA’s master plan proposed 18 monorail corridors totaling over 300 km, promising quick builds, low land acquisition, and less disruption than a Metro (sound familiar?). Political shifts and a PIL stalled the contract, and by 2008 the DMK ditched monorail for a more conventional Metro, only for AIADMK to revive the monorail bid in 2011; then cancel it again when bidders ghosted.

## What Happened During

Come 2014, the grand 111 km Phase 1 got slashed to 57 km across three corridors (Vandalur–Velachery, Poonamallee–Kathipara, Poonamallee–Vadapalani), but tenders still flopped. Finally in 2018, the first corridor got approval, until 2020, when one of those routes quietly switched to Metro rails under CMRL’s tender for Porur–Poonamallee. Monorail dreams melted into Metro steel.

## What Happened After

While monorail plans flatlined, Chennai Metro steamed ahead: Phase I opened its first stretch (Koyambedu–Alandur) in June 2015 and fully launched both lines by September 2016; its Phase I extension reached Wimco Nagar by February 2021. Phase II’s foundation was laid in November 2020 with multiple new corridors on the way, and by 2025 the network had outgrown those old monorail blueprints — proof that sometimes you overpromise rubber‑tired futurism and end up with concrete rails.

These metros were originally planned to be built for only 3 years, but the signs never changed — 36 months later, it was still 36 months. And the roads were getting thinner and thinner so the construction could happen. Although this is less of a delay than the monorail, still unnacceptable.
