> For years, people have wondered what Beethoven’s tenth symphony—the “Unfinished”—would have sounded like if he had lived a little bit longer. Now, an AI has [taken on the task](https://www.beethovenx-ai.com)<!--They’re website renders terrible on Gecko btw-->, with substantial human involvement. Read about the effort, then compare the outcome to [this earlier attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-9MbCLsbSg) by the composer Barry Cooper. Which seems more authentic to you—and which has more artistic value? Are there other unfinished works you would like to see completed in a similar way?

The AI one sounds better to me. Although that’s very subjective because both mostly sound the same — it has better bass drops and tempo (I can’t comment on the tone, it’s a tie).

But according to most people, the one with more artistic value and authenticity is probably the one by Barry Cooper — just because it’s created by a human. Also, because of that, you can probably sell it for more.

I would love to see [The Outsiders](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/58LGoQGFnbNb9PqDTrLfrT) by Juice WRLD finished, because most of the songs from there have just been shoved into other albums by his estate and record.
