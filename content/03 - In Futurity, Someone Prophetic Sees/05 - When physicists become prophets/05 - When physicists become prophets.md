> Not all fortune tellers are mystics. Michio Kaku is an award-winning theoretical physicist whose side business is predicting the future in books like *Physics of the Future and The Future of Humanity*. Explore [some of his predictions](https://futurism.com/michio-kaku-prominent-futurist-predictions), then discuss with your team: which of his predictions do you find too alarmist? Which ones do you most look forward to?

## Drones

 I feel like his take is right, look at that one drone which took down multiple firefighting planes in the California [wildfire because someone didn’t pilot it properly.](https://apnews.com/article/california-wildfires-los-angeles-guilty-drone-8406f5ed22b73bd597fc6978eba54dc9)

## Extraterrestrial Life

 I don’t agree with this (maybe kind of). We’ve been trying for thousands of years, and we still haven’t found any success. Look at how long voyager 1 and 2 were in the air.

## The Evolution Of AI

This is already true, look at OpenAI’s o3-pro. You have **absolutely no** chance of getting 85% on GPQA Diamond. Even the open source, tiny, 600m param models are getting [**insane** scores on these benchmarks](https://artificialanalysis.ai/?models=gpt-oss-120b%2Cgpt-oss-20b%2Cgpt-5%2Cdeepseek-v3-1-reasoning%2Cqwen3-30b-a3b-2507-reasoning%2Cqwen3-30b-a3b-2507%2Cqwen3-0.6b-instruct%2Cqwen3-0.6b-instruct-reasoning#intelligence-evaluations). **You can run this stuff on your own hardware**.

## Colonizing Alien Worlds

This will definitely happen, I’m not saying any time soon — but it will happen within the lifetime of Elon Musks’s ancestors.

## Bitcoin

Tell that to the people who got a 7,780,000% return on their investment in 2009. Bitcoin is the sole reason regular people know about cryptography, encryption, TLS, and everything else. 
He's not spitting facts, he's choking on misinformation.

Also, don’t get me started on the “It’s not backed by anything”. **THE US DOLLAR WASN’T BACKED BY ANYTHING SINCE 1971.**

## Driverless Cars

Yes, this is already happening — the [Tesla’s HW4 FSD drives better than most humans would](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaFSD/comments/1h8zxna/dont_forget_to_compare_fsd_to_human_drivers/).
