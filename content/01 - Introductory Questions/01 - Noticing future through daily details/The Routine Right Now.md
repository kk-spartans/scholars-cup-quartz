The best way to do this is to trace out a person's (my) daily routine.

 - I wake up from a bed, with a *digital* alarm. My bed is also elevated and made of actual cotton / memory foam.
 
 - I walk out of the room and see a flatscreen tv the width of a medium sized novel. And a lot of technology with silicon inside, I also live in a house that's very livable.
 
 - I brush my teeth with a toothbrush and some toothpaste, and then I take a bath inside a bathroom with abundant water.
 
 - I eat breakfast, sometimes cereal.
 
 - I walk out and notice insanely tall buildings, ACs, and lights everywhere.
 
 - I get on a bus that has a diesel or electric engine.
 
 - I go to school, where I learn things like Computer Science, which is a relatively new subject
 
 - I get back on the bus and go home.
 
 - I now get to do things like coding and watching Youtube, which is encrypted using math that we could've never fathomed a few decades ago and transferred through cables so thick they could be highways.
 
 -  I then go to sleep, using speakers to play music.
