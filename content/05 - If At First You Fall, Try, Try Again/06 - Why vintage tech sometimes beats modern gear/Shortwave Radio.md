I don’t defend myself with this — shortwave radio is basically immune to the apocalypse. It works anywhere, and doesn’t take hours to align with emergency sattelites (*cough* apple emergency sattelite SOS *cough*).

And if you aim it right, your shortwave signal can bounce off the ionosphere and maybe travel to the other side of the world. Actually cool.
