How does it burn? Depends on the material, but some common ones are:

## Most Hydrocarbons

^8bf3e5

> Fuel (C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>) + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O



For example, methane:

> CH<sub>4</sub>​ + 2O<sub>2</sub> ​→ CO<sub>2</sub> ​+ 2H<sub>2</sub>​O

## Most Metals

For example, magnesium:

> 2Mg + O<sub>2</sub> → 2MgO

## Phosphorus

> 4P + 5O<sub>2</sub>​ → 2P<sub>2</sub>​O<sub>5</sub>​

## Hydrogen

> 2H<sub>2</sub>​ + O<sub>2</sub> ​→ 2H<sub>2</sub>​O

## Sulfur

> S + O<sub>2</sub> → SO<sub>2</sub>

Blue flame, smells awful.

## Carbon

> C + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub>

## Metal Hydrides

For example, sodium hydride:

> ​2NaH + O<sub>2</sub>​ → Na<sub>2</sub>​O + H<sub>2</sub>​O
